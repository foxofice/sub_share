1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,940
Man, it's cold out here.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,440
How much longer must we stare at nothing?

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,030
We can't make money sitting here.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,110
The prince chickened out.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,950
We should've gone to Wessex.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,740
No doubt about it.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,040
Seriously,

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,450
we got the short end of--

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,720
Incoming!

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,260
Look out!

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,270
Come on!

12
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,020
Make haste and come at me!

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,770
You can't get to Valhalla
just standing around like that!

14
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,530
What are you? Scarecrows?

15
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,490
-Damn bastard.
-I can't hold back any longer.

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,740
Does every last one of you
not have the balls to fight?

17
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,710
Ragnar!

18
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,090
Tolerating his attacks
dishonors us as soldiers!

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,510
We must retaliate!

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,470
The soldiers are ready to fight!

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,680
The 4,000 of us
will surely defeat Thorkell!

22
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,140
Not yet.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,180
This is Thorkell we're facing.

24
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,560
We must be shrewd.

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,100
We were tasked with the siege
by His Majesty himself.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,770
Now's our chance to show our valor.

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,320
No!

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,070
When the time comes,
His Highness will give the order.

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,320
For now, we bare the attack.

30
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,910
Ragnar!

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,210
"Then said Jesus unto him,

32
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,040
'Return thy sword to its place.

33
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,550
For all who take the sword

34
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,090
shall perish with the sword.'"

35
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,300
Father,

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,560
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but may we have some privacy?

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,940
Who cares about the orders
of that cowardly prince?

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,650
We won't stay silent forever.

39
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,020
Come on, let's do it!

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,360
Yeah, that's right!

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,200
There is no need to worry.

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,240
Once winter comes,
the order to retreat will surely come.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,580
We only need to be patient until then.

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,040
Is he joking?

45
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,000
God,

46
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,670
please protect His Highness.

47
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,050
Damn it.

48
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,010
What a pathetic opponent.

49
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,050
The commander is working hard.

50
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,140
Are they bothering you again?

51
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,770
Shut up, Asgeir.

52
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,850
If they don't fight us, there is no war!

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,610
You speak too loudly.

54
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,770
And, they're being cautious.

55
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,650
It's because their commander
is the Danish prince.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,150
Huh?

57
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,240
What?

58
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,160
The prince is here?

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,910
Oh, didn't I tell you?

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,870
I think it's Prince Canute,
second in line for the throne.

61
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,250
Mother is here.

62
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,340
Ylva, too.

63
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,550
Ari and the others are loafing
while watching the sheep

64
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,600
despite the big fuss
about a lost sheep just the other day.

65
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,140
Oh, that's right. It's dinner time.

66
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,810
I must go and tell Father!

67
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,860
Father!

68
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,280
Father!

69
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,870
Tonight, we're eating meat
to celebrate the Yule.

70
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,590
Oh, that's right.
The winter solstice is already here.

71
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,170
It's so warm,
that it completely slipped my mind.

72
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,840
This place is nice.

73
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,180
Plenty of pasture.

74
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Moving here was the right choice.

75
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,650
Ylva says it's annoying
because we can't get any slaves out here

76
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,320
even though
we've never owned a slave before.

77
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,070
It's just like her to say that.

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,530
I like it here.

79
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,790
Since we came,
Mother seems to be feeling better too.

80
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,670
Thorfinn.

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,670
What?

82
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,090
You are my eldest son.

83
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,050
You must protect your mother and sister.

84
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,670
You understand?

85
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,220
Yep.

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,680
The two of them are waiting
for your return home.

87
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,060
It's a very happy thing
to have people like that in your life.

88
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,990
Do you understand?

89
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,610
Yeah.

90
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,120
That's why you should
give up pursuing revenge.

91
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,040
Do you think revenge would make me happy?

92
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
The village!

93
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,230
Father, what do we do?
They're under attack!

94
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:53,030
Mother! Ylva!

95
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,380
Father!

96
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,910
That wasn't… my country.

97
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,630
It was warm… with waves of grassy fields…
as far as the eye could see.

98
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,700
NOVEMBER 1013 A.D., OUTSKIRTS OF BATH

99
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,970
I wonder what's going on
in our leader's head.

100
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,850
Winter will be here soon.

101
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,810
The main forces are already up north.

102
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,820
Yet we're stuck here
in this bleak village.

103
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,570
Well, at least we'll earn
a few silvers before going home.

104
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,120
In that case,
we should attack a bigger town.

105
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,290
Bristol is close by, isn't it?

106
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,950
Are you a fool?

107
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,710
What can a mere 100 men do?

108
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,830
What? "Fool"?

109
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,380
You call me an fool?

110
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,630
You heard me?

111
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,170
Seems like only your ears aren't stupid.

112
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,430
What did you say, bastard?

113
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,800
What about it?

114
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,060
Well, after we plunder two or three
more villages, we'll be done for the year.

115
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,150
We can try again next year.

116
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
I wonder if there will be a next year.

117
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,320
Huh?

118
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,410
We've been rampaging
through England for 10 years now.

119
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,870
This year was notably cutthroat.

120
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,330
Even the King of England fled the country.

121
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,000
The King of Denmark has already won.

122
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,750
The war is over.

123
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,260
Really? Isn't it too early to tell?

124
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,430
London still has Thorkell.

125
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,760
You saw how ridiculously strong
that bastard is.

126
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,850
Thorkell, huh?

127
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,350
He's certainly strong.

128
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,770
He's a Norse warrior just like all of us.

129
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,070
With England losing, it wouldn't be
a surprise if he abandoned them now.

130
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,400
-Get him, Tore!
-Good lord.

131
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,280
This again?

132
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,410
Stop! Enough!

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,080
What's the problem here?

134
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,040
Ake called Tore a fool.

135
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,590
Tore got angry.

136
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,420
Ake wouldn't apologize,
so he insulted him back.

137
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,840
What did he say?

138
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,630
Cattle thief.

139
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,970
He really said that?

140
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,140
Then it can't be helped.

141
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,310
Make sure to notify Askeladd
of whoever dies.

142
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,980
What a nuisance.

143
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,170
It's a bountiful land.

144
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,260
It looks like the land of my dream.

145
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,890
A stark contrast to Iceland.

146
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,180
The village must be
buried in snow about now.

147
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,010
You're awake early, Thorfinn.

148
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,140
The sun has yet to rise.

149
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,860
Did the ruckus of the men keep you up?

150
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,450
Well, don't judge them too harshly.

151
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,410
They've grown restless
with all the ceaseless marching.

152
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:38,910
Sometimes they need to do this to unwind.

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,960
Don't speak to me like we're friends.

154
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,000
Lately, you've been getting
the wrong impression.

155
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm not your friend.

156
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,340
You're trying to manipulate me, right?

157
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,100
You can go on with your conceit…

158
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,180
until the day

159
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,270
I slash your throat.

160
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,150
You're scary.

161
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,240
If that puny kid lunges at me now,
then he's certainly grown up.

162
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,030
Well, time is on the side of the young.

163
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,580
While you grow, I only get older.

164
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,540
The day I lose to you is coming.

165
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,630
It's only natural.

166
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,090
Everyone dies, no matter their strength.

167
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,090
Look around you, Thorfinn.

168
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,800
These stones weren't laid here

169
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,720
by the English of today, the Saxons.

170
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,270
This was the work of the people
before the Saxons.

171
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
They were a strong race.

172
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,440
But 500 years ago,
they were destroyed by the Saxons.

173
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,160
The Romans.

174
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,450
The country was called Britannia.

175
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,040
It was a sophisticated civilization.

176
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,540
Much more than ours now.

177
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,630
You're talking in circles.

178
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,550
What's your point?

179
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,930
You're impatient, aren't you?

180
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,550
You should listen to your elders.

181
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,930
Well, my point is,

182
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,810
the world of mankind
ages slowly but surely.

183
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,150
The Romans were wiped out by the Saxons,

184
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,740
and now the Saxons
will be wiped out by us.

185
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,370
And the glory of the Roman Empire

186
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,200
will fade further into the past.

187
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,580
Anyway, according to
what the Christians say,

188
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,920
the Last Judgment
will befall us in 20 years.

189
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,930
It's said that when that day comes,
all humans will be killed by God

190
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,690
and the world as we know it
will be destroyed.

191
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,310
Ragnarok.

192
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,450
Look, Thorfinn.

193
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,860
Isn't it ridiculous?

194
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,410
It's the dawn… of the twilight age.

195
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,390
There's a horse.

196
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,980
An English soldier?

197
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,480
No, he's friendly.

198
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,770
That's strange.

199
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,820
We're the only ones stationed out here.

200
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,650
Hey!

201
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,570
You there! Halt!

202
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,040
We are the Askeladd army under King Sweyn!

203
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,160
Where are you coming from?

204
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,290
Oh, you're part of the main force?

205
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm with Ragnar's force
under His Highness Prince Canute!

206
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,130
-I've come with a message.
-Prince Canute.

207
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,470
Are they nearby?

208
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,010
Alas, the main force is already up north.

209
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,270
They're returning to home base.

210
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,890
Then what are you doing here?

211
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,940
We just stopped by a village
to help ourselves.

212
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,940
You separated of your own volition?

213
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,860
No need to be so stiff.

214
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,950
Your horse must be tired.

215
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700
Why not trade for a new one?

216
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,830
Thorkell did?

217
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,590
Yes. He's already reached that point.

218
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:59,340
They are about 500 men.
He's only brought his best fighters.

219
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,220
They traced the footsteps
of the main force.

220
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,390
Soon, they will reach Marlborough.

221
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,760
-Is that true?
-Only 500 men to fight the main force?

222
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,930
Has Thorkell lost his mind?

223
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,560
And the London siege army?

224
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,650
Prince Canute must have had 4,000 men.

225
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,190
They were crushed not long ago.

226
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,190
I'm one of the survivors.

227
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,580
What's that?

228
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,130
Thorkell led the charge
coming out from the fort.

229
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,990
Every one of them was as strong as a bear.

230
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,120
There was nothing we could do.

231
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,330
They're headed right for the main force.

232
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,500
Your Highness!

233
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,260
Lord, please let them rest in peace

234
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,220
-and save their souls.
-Your Highness!

235
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,930
Thorkell is closing in!

236
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,220
We must leave now!

237
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,400
I found the prince!

238
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,410
And then?

239
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,870
What happened to Prince Canute?

240
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,290
He's been captured.

241
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,630
He's with Thorkell's army.

242
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,710
The surviving soldiers are concentrating
their efforts on saving His Highness,

243
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,550
but we've only gathered
fewer than 400 men.

244
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,300
Morale is understandably low.

245
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,350
I'm on my way to ask for support
from the main force.

246
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,770
Please join us.

247
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,060
Even 100 men would be of great help.

248
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,360
What do we do?

249
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,570
You're the one who decides.

250
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,700
Askeladd.

251
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:39,830
My God. This is no time
to peacefully fade into the twilight.

252
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,130
Huh?

253
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't you hear it, Bjorn?

254
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,010
That sound.

255
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,890
It's the coming of Ragnarok.

256
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,600
What?

257
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,870
Bury him.

258
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,540
The horse he was riding too.

259
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,460
You…

260
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,300
You hear me, you bastards?

261
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,550
Listen well!

262
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,930
We are now heading out
to save Prince Canute.

263
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,060
We will face 500 men under Thorkell!
But we will not align with other armies.

264
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,430
This is the moment we risk it all!

265
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,610
His Highness Prince Canute
is second in line to the Danish throne.

266
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,280
No matter which side we hand him to,
there's bound to be a great reward.

267
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,990
Can you imagine…

268
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,370
the riches that will be bestowed upon us
by Denmark or England.

269
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:02,290
We won't let anyone
steal it from under our noses.

270
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,130
Yeah.

271
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,210
Let's do this!

272
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,710
Victory will be ours!

273
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,130
Let's do this!

274
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,060
Why are you riling them up?

275
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,730
It's Thorkell we're facing.

276
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:27,150
-Do we even stand a chance?
-Who knows?

277
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,650
What? "Who knows?" What do you mean?

278
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,990
It's the twilight age, Bjorn.

279
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,330
If we're going out,
might as well go out fighting.

280
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
