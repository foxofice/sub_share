1
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:50,876
Bring a human to me

2
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,293
if you want this cat alive.

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,960
<i>No lives matter.</i>

4
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:03,210
<i>It's just a cat.</i>

5
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,460
<i>Then, why am I running to find a human?</i>

6
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:12,960
<i>To save Meowy?</i>

7
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:19,751
<i>What a stupid reason.</i>

8
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,043
<i>I like blood.</i>

9
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:28,543
<i>The taste, the smell.</i>

10
00:01:29,168 --> 00:01:30,376
<i>It makes me feel death.</i>

11
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:35,918
<i>But… I just realized lately…</i>

12
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,335
<i>that blood is warm,</i>

13
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,168
<i>and cozy.</i>

14
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,668
Why did you save me?

15
00:02:08,043 --> 00:02:09,960
I was going to get you killed.

16
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:24,501
What a stupid reason.

17
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,043
Sorry for lying to you.

18
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:38,543
Since you saved Meowy,

19
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:41,418
I'll let you touch my boobs.

20
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:57,335
Great!

21
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:03,168
Ouch!

22
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,835
That hurts…

23
00:04:47,085 --> 00:04:50,751
CHAINSAW MAN

24
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,710
Can you move?

25
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,126
Not even a finger.

26
00:05:05,835 --> 00:05:07,876
Run away with Meowy.

27
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,168
The chainsaw can't come out.

28
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,960
<i>Because I don't have enough blood?</i>

29
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:29,960
Found you at last.

30
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:34,210
Was it you who killed Bat?

31
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,085
He was my man.

32
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:40,460
Oh, my.

33
00:05:40,543 --> 00:05:43,376
You look pretty cute.

34
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,585
I like your face, so I'll let you live.

35
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,085
And those behind me?

36
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,418
I'll kill them.

37
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:02,668
Then die!

38
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,085
He's fighting with his life

39
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,876
just to touch some boobs?

40
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,043
No way.

41
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:05,043
Bat got killed by a little puppy like you?

42
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:12,793
Our dream was to eat
all the humans on earth.

43
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:16,376
We lacked tactics,
but it was a beautiful dream.

44
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:20,043
Our dream was ruined by a puppy like you.

45
00:07:21,126 --> 00:07:23,460
It's such a pity to kill a pretty boy.

46
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:26,043
But you should die nonetheless.

47
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:30,293
How can I die before touching some boobs?

48
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:32,210
Boring.

49
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,918
Got killed by such a vulgar guy.

50
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,543
You have my sympathy, Bat.

51
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,960
<i>What a stupid reason.</i>

52
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:45,876
<i>Everyone takes this seriously, except you.</i>

53
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:12,626
Everybody looks down on my goal.

54
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,543
<i>They want revenge,</i>

55
00:08:14,626 --> 00:08:16,293
<i>to protect their families,</i>

56
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,793
<i>or to save their cats.</i>

57
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,793
What a bunch of nonsense.

58
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:22,960
Your dreams are all so grand.

59
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,835
Why don't we have a battle of dreams?

60
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:28,668
If I can kill you,

61
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:32,293
then your dream is even dumber than mine.

62
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,293
You make cute noises.

63
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,251
Little puppy barks louder. Woof woof.

64
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:39,918
Fine. I'll eat you.

65
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,043
Come on.

66
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:45,835
But first, you have to win against me
in this battle of dreams.

67
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,126
<i>Devil…</i>

68
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,668
Lunch time.

69
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:11,418
Kon.

70
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,710
This is Leech Devil.

71
00:10:22,793 --> 00:10:24,418
Can I eat it?

72
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,418
Yes.

73
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:44,335
Leech Devil destroyed.

74
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,751
Rookies, find the survivors,
check their status, and get them out.

75
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:48,668
-Got it.
-Got it.

76
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,293
Mr. Himeno, please watch out for Devils.

77
00:10:52,376 --> 00:10:53,376
Okay.

78
00:10:59,126 --> 00:11:01,376
You and Blood Fiend need to
answer a few questions.

79
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:02,793
That hurts!

80
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:04,793
-Battle of dreams…
-And Meowy?

81
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,960
We'll send the cat to
an animal hospital for a health check.

82
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,126
Your arm…

83
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:30,210
I brought it back.

84
00:11:31,418 --> 00:11:33,543
It recovered after they gave you
a blood transfusion.

85
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,376
You do resemble Devils a lot.

86
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,793
Weren't you chatting away
with a Devil too?

87
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,543
I saw it.

88
00:11:44,626 --> 00:11:46,293
You are indeed ignorant.

89
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:51,126
Devil Hunters make contracts
with Devils to fight other Devils.

90
00:11:52,876 --> 00:11:55,001
I have a contract with Fox Devil.

91
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,335
<i>It gives me a Devil's power.</i>

92
00:11:57,418 --> 00:12:00,001
<i>In return, the fox will eat
a part of my body.</i>

93
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,710
This time, I gave it my skin.

94
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:05,460
Sounds painful.

95
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,293
Devils always want humans dead.

96
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:11,543
The same goes for Fiends.

97
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:15,835
Power is great.

98
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:23,001
<i>The monitor shows that
you two left your patrol area.</i>

99
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:24,335
<i>Not only that,</i>

100
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:28,168
<i>a lot of your blood was left in the house</i>

101
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:30,585
<i>in which Bat Devil was
most likely located.</i>

102
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,835
You almost got killed
by Blood Fiend, right?

103
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:37,251
I don't know the reason,

104
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:40,501
but you sound like
you're siding with them again.

105
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:44,251
Am I? I don't know.

106
00:12:47,918 --> 00:12:51,168
My daughter wants to see
the guy with the chainsaw.

107
00:12:51,751 --> 00:12:52,835
Thank you.

108
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:57,126
A Devil came to the company
and threatened to eat me.

109
00:12:57,626 --> 00:13:00,001
I wanted to escape but I saw him wearing
the Public Safety Sector's uniform.

110
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,501
So I came here to say thank you.

111
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,210
He said a man's life doesn't matter.

112
00:13:04,793 --> 00:13:06,793
The Devil threw my car aside
with me in it.

113
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:08,501
It was a Devil with
a chainsaw on his head…

114
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,043
If I do a further investigation
and report it to my superiors,

115
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:19,335
both you and the Blood Fiend
will be punished.

116
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,251
But considering that no one died,

117
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,751
I'll let you walk away

118
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:26,751
if you promise me one thing.

119
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,835
You have to listen to my orders.

120
00:13:34,876 --> 00:13:37,085
You are stupid, childish,
and have no moral compass.

121
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:41,835
I'm your senior,
and I regard myself as morally righteous.

122
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,126
If you're willing to obey me,

123
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,751
you can still live your current life.

124
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:52,251
So? Answer me if you understand.

125
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,751
Sure. I'll remember that.

126
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:00,835
Don't worry.

127
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:04,918
I don't have any
great ambitions like you lot.

128
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:07,168
My dreams are petty.

129
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:12,001
But I'll work as hard as you.

130
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,835
Look forward to it.

131
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:21,501
And remember to use honorifics
when you talk.

132
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:24,835
Fine. I'll think about that too.

133
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,710
Right? Told you I'm not to blame.

134
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,751
So get this thing off of me.

135
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,543
Is it really fine?

136
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:45,376
If this Fiend kills someone in the future,

137
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,501
you'll be held responsible
for letting her go, Aki.

138
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,668
We are Devil Hunters.

139
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:52,918
Whether they are Devils or Fiends,

140
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:55,168
we have to use every resource available.

141
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:57,751
But enemies will always be enemies.

142
00:14:57,835 --> 00:14:59,168
They are just tools.

143
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:02,585
I have no intention
to get familiar with you.

144
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:35,876
Come in.

145
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,543
Excuse me.

146
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:50,376
<i>He said he walked out of
the patrol area without noticing,</i>

147
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:54,585
and then he saw a house
that gave out a bad Devil vibe

148
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:57,376
and bumped into Bat Devil.

149
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:01,543
Denji turned into a chainsaw
and killed Bat Devil,

150
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:04,043
but was then attacked by Leech Devil,

151
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:06,793
which was then killed by Division 4.

152
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:11,918
Other than that, no pieces of Gun
were found on Bat and Leech.

153
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:13,668
That's all.

154
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,001
Thank you.

155
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,793
But how did Denji and Power

156
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:25,626
wander off so far without noticing?

157
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:29,293
Because they are incredibly stupid.

158
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:33,626
Leaving their patrol area is
against regulations, remember?

159
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,585
No members died this time

160
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:39,501
and two Devils were destroyed.

161
00:16:39,585 --> 00:16:41,251
I think we can let it go.

162
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,418
I see.

163
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:50,918
I'll leave then.

164
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:55,668
Are you less rigid now, Hayakawa?

165
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:00,751
Is it because you live with Denji?

166
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,751
How is that possible?

167
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,335
I didn't change at all.

168
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:39,418
Where…

169
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,960
What's for lunch?

170
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:09,751
Curry.

171
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,085
Great.

172
00:19:14,876 --> 00:19:16,585
What's that? A Devil?

173
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:24,001
Hey, hey!

174
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:26,835
This house is tiny.

175
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:34,835
I hope you can give a room to Power.

176
00:19:35,335 --> 00:19:40,251
You'll definitely be
a good collar to both of them.

177
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:43,876
-Why are you sending trouble to my home?
-Meowy, stop there.

178
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
-Because I trust you the most.
-<i>Looks delicious.</i>

179
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,376
-Because I trust you the most.
-<i>You can't just take the food.</i>

180
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,626
-This is mine now.
-That's my best toast!

181
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,960
Oh… Okay.

182
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,626
It's weird for her to keep living here.

183
00:20:01,626 --> 00:20:02,460
Right.

184
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:08,210
Don't worry. Power said she would behave.

185
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,210
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

186
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,376
I hate vegetables. Away with you!

187
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,751
The carrots.

188
00:20:17,626 --> 00:20:18,626
No throwing vegetables here.

189
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,835
You!

190
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,126
Don't you think
you're being disrespectful to farmers?

191
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,293
You Devil.

192
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,126
Toilet.

193
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,751
I'm used to flushing it once in a while.

194
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:30,960
Flush it!

195
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:32,376
It stinks.

196
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,585
I'm used to taking a shower
once in a while.

197
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,835
Take a shower!

198
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,251
You stink.

199
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:39,418
What's up with you?

200
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:41,918
Humans are so troublesome.

201
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:43,251
Right, Meowy?

202
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,085
That little…

203
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:56,251
Showed up without notice
and messed around the house.

204
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,001
Devils don't know how to flush toilets?

205
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,001
And she even left all the vegetables.

206
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,376
Hey, you!

207
00:21:03,668 --> 00:21:05,251
Hey Poop Devil.

208
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:08,251
Your poop stains are stuck on the toilet.

209
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:19,001
Didn't we agree that
I'll let you touch my boobs?

210
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:20,460
Come then.

211
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,710
Come on. Don't you want them?

212
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,085
Come and touch them…

213
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:48,335
On one condition.

214
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,960
You can only touch my boobs three times.

215
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:54,793
Three times…

216
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,251
The first is for saving Meowy.

217
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,210
The second is for killing Bat.

218
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:05,793
And the third, for helping me
before the samurai head.

219
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,793
I was just lying when I promised you that.

220
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:12,293
But I'll let you touch them three times
as a reward for your work.

221
00:22:12,376 --> 00:22:14,126
Do it with gratitude in your heart.

222
00:22:21,793 --> 00:22:22,876
Angel…
