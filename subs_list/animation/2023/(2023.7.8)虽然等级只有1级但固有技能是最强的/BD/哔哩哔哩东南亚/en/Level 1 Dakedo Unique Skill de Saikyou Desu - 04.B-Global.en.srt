1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,240
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,070
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,910
in a crazy world where everything
is dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,330
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,540
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,210
And today I'm facing off against...

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,880
a rare monster?!

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,550
I had no idea drops from monsters
could be used that way!

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,230
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
MOVING TO A NEW PLACE!
JUST RELAXING AT HOME

11
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,150
TELULU LEVEL 4

12
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,740
Ah! That's a rare monster!

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,610
What?!

14
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,030
You're not getting away!

15
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,790
What's this?

16
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,380
That's the first time I've seen
a rare monster drop anything!

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,090
Emily...

18
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,260
Emily,

19
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,090
would you put this on?

20
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,010
What? Y-You mean...

21
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,350
I want you to have it.

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,940
You've made me so happy!
I'll treasure this!

23
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,440
Great!

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,230
Now you can rake in the profits for us!

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,530
Huh? Rake in... profits?

26
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,570
Oh, I guess you can't hear it,
like with the seeds and stuff.

27
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,160
PUT ON, FIGHT AS USUAL, DOUBLE DROPS

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,620
PUT ON, FIGHT AS USUAL, DOUBLE DROPS
I heard a voice when I picked that up.

29
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,910
PUT ON, FIGHT AS USUAL, DOUBLE DROPS
It's apparently a necklace

30
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,160
PUT ON, FIGHT AS USUAL, DOUBLE DROPS
that doubles item drops!

31
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,620
That's the kind of thing...

32
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,580
Emily?

33
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,170
That's the kind of thing
you need to say first!

34
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,370
Huh? Wait, what do you mean?

35
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,810
Wow, look at them all!

36
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,060
This double drop rate is amazing!

37
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,860
Can I help with anything?

38
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,780
That's all right.
I'll be done in no time.

39
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,870
It must be rough on her,
having a tiny kitchen like this.

40
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,200
Hey, Emily...

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,040
I think I'd like to move somewhere else.

42
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,670
Do you want to move?

43
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,210
Yeah. With what we're making now,

44
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,090
I think it's about time
to get a nicer place.

45
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,930
I... I see.

46
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,720
What kind of place would
you like to live in?

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,850
No, you can choose whatever you...

48
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,690
I can go with you?!

49
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,480
Of course.

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,320
It'll be after we save a little
more money, of course, but...

51
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,940
It's okay to work hard,

52
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,570
but don't work too hard, okay?

53
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,320
I know.

54
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,700
Tomorrow, I'll gather bamboo shoots again
and get home at the usual time.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,830
Good!

56
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,250
Is that...

57
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,550
Hmm... These are a bit
difficult to appraise.

58
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,640
You there.

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,140
Would you mind letting me
have those bamboo shoots?

60
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,970
Huh?

61
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,360
Uh, I mean, I don't mind
giving you one of them...

62
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,110
Thank you.
I'll just take one, then.

63
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,450
Whoa, that was amazing!

64
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,290
D-Does it taste that bad?

65
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,170
Despite being raw,
it's not bitter at all!

66
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,930
It's so juicy and sweet! I've never
had a bamboo shoot like this before!

67
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,510
It's like... It's like...

68
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,640
a rare monster of flavor!

69
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,520
Who the heck is this lady?!

70
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,770
Please let me buy all of these
marvelous bamboo shoots.

71
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,230
Huh? Uh, but these are...

72
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,360
I-It's all right!
She's welcome to have all of them!

73
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,160
Really? Well, okay, then.

74
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,450
Thank you!

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,870
I can't put a price on
this great flavor, so...

76
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,540
Please accept this
as a token of my gratitude!

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,340
The way this is going...
Is she about to pay big for these?!

78
00:05:59,050 --> 00:05:59,960
Huh?

79
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,970
Well, thanks!

80
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,590
Fantastic bamboo shoot boy!

81
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,390
Twenty thousand...
Twenty thousand pilos?

82
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,350
I mean, that's a high price for
some bamboo shoots, right?

83
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,770
It'd be wrong of me to feel disappointed.

84
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,320
Ryota, that lady...

85
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,860
Was she someone important?

86
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,030
"Important" doesn't begin to cover it!

87
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,740
That was Eric Macy, the epicure.

88
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,950
Any food she approves of will fetch
a high price among the gourmet crowd!

89
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,450
I see...

90
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,210
Ryota, I'll skip all the formalities.

91
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,130
Would you sign an exclusive
contract with us?

92
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,670
A contract?

93
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:43,220
Your bamboo shoots will soon
be a hot topic all over Secro.

94
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,720
When that happens, I want the rights
to sell them as a branded product.

95
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,560
I want to sell them
as Ryota's Bamboo Shoots!

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,930
A branded product?

97
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,850
That would be great for me,
but are they really worth

98
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,020
They are!

99
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,610
I'll pay a signing bonus in addition
to the cost of the shoots!

100
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,860
All right.

101
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,690
Huh?

102
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,700
I'll trust you with all of it.

103
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,240
Happy to partner with you, Erza.

104
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,410
Same!

105
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,670
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1
Okay, gotta raise more my strength stat today.

106
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,040
I'll be at rank S soon—

107
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,340
Who's that?

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,170
Watch out!

109
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,470
Now!

110
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,380
Right!

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,650
What the heck was that?

112
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,110
Sorry, but try not to get in our way.

113
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,190
Princess Margaret is on the job.

114
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,030
Princess?

115
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,200
You've got a princess, too?
This world is amazing.

116
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,500
She's using an air box.

117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,790
An air box?

118
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,630
Yeah. Do you know how monsters sometimes
don't drop anything after you kill them?

119
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,260
Oh, yeah... For most people, I guess
the monsters in Nihonium don't...

120
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,800
It's apparently a useless dungeon
where nothing drops at all.

121
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,890
Yep. Recent research has revealed
that they're actually dropping air.

122
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,310
Really?!

123
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,730
Yeah. So we had the idea to put
the air in a box and sell it.

124
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,860
And it's not just any air.
It's handmade by Princess Margaret!

125
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,610
It's impressive that you had
the idea to sell air.

126
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,280
Yep! It's our top product!

127
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,700
For real? Is this the princess effect?

128
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,950
Is that a magic cart?

129
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,580
Yep. It lets us carry a lot
of air boxes at once.

130
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,710
We can't have the princess coming
in and out of the dungeon too much.

131
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,970
Oh, yeah. Just being able to make fewer
trips would make it so much easier.

132
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,140
A magic cart...

133
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,180
I've wanted one for ages,
but it'd be a major purchase.

134
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,100
I'll have to talk it over with Emily, too.

135
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,980
So now I'm not sure whether to get
a new house or a magic cart first.

136
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,400
We should get a magic cart, then.

137
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,820
If we use it to save up money,

138
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,160
we'll be able to afford a new place soon.

139
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,990
Good point.
Though we'd have to put off moving,

140
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,080
and I'd feel bad doing that to you...

141
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
It's perfectly fine!

142
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,500
I like my life with you
in this little house very much!

143
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,670
Emily...

144
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,420
You're right.

145
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,220
I guess we'll be here
in the Emily house for a while longer.

146
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,470
Yes!

147
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,640
Well, then, should we go
to the magic cart shop tomorrow?

148
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,980
We'll be able to see
the owner's little girl, Olga, again!

149
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,440
Is that...

150
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,190
It's Olga!

151
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,280
Are you okay?

152
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Daddy... Daddy has...

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Did something happen
to your daddy?

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,120
Daddy hasn't come home.

155
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,580
What?

156
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,210
Did he tell you where he was going?

157
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:09,630
I don't know. He said he was
going to pick flowers.

158
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,760
Flowers?

159
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,050
The only place to get flower drops
around here is a dungeon called Arsenic.

160
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,970
So there's a good chance
that's where he is.

161
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,560
Let's go to Arsenic!

162
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,230
Yes!

163
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,400
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
I wonder how many there are...

164
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,070
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
I'm talking more now than I do!

165
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,030
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

166
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,570
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
My daddy's feet are stinky!

167
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,070
My daddy's feet are stinky!

168
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,570
ARSENIC LEVEL 1

169
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,320
ARSENIC LEVEL 1
So this is Arsenic.

170
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
ARSENIC LEVEL 1

171
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,500
The monsters here are called Danderocks,
and they don't move.

172
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,330
They don't attack, either.

173
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,170
I see. Then we can—

174
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,260
Or not. Looks like we have
to kill them after all.

175
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,140
The bullet bounced off?!

176
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,100
Yoda, stand back!

177
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,400
Of course! Between your increased power
and the strength of that hammer...

178
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,360
Way to go, Emily!

179
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,490
Let's hurry.

180
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,410
ARSENIC LEVEL 10

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,160
There he is! That's Olga's father!

182
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,290
Are you okay?!

183
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,670
Oh, no...

184
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,180
He's asleep!

185
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,590
Hey, wake up!

186
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,720
He's not waking up.

187
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,390
E-Emily?

188
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,350
He made Olga worry so much,
and we find out he's...

189
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,770
Wake up right now!

190
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,030
What's going on?!

191
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,320
Oh, it's you two.

192
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,950
Darn it, I was having such a nice nap.

193
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,700
Daddy, you left your sweet little girl
behind to wander around?

194
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,000
I-I apologize!

195
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,170
What in the world were you doing here?

196
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,170
Olga was worried sick about you.

197
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,800
I came to get parts for my incredible
new magic cart prototype.

198
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,260
Namely, Heavy Rocks and Light Rocks.

199
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,480
I caught the heavy rock,
but as for the light rock...

200
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,610
Well, the Danderocks blocked my path,
and I couldn't get anywhere.

201
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,280
A prototype?
The one you mentioned before?

202
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,570
Look there. That's it.

203
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,620
Is that rock... flying?!

204
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,910
Light Rocks are lighter than air,
and they're rare monsters,

205
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,660
so I just can't get one.

206
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,500
I see.

207
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,580
It might be tough to do solo,

208
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,750
but I bet two people could handle it.

209
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,340
You're light, Emily,
but your hammer's heavy!

210
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,260
A-Are you all right, Yoda?

211
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,220
N-No problem!

212
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,680
I got my strength up to rank S
in Nihonium last time.

213
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,270
I'll try my best, too!

214
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,980
Ah! This is what I needed!

215
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,410
It's pretty, sure,
but what did you need that for?

216
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,820
Let's step outside for now.

217
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,160
There. We'll leave it be for a while
and watch what happens.

218
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,920
If it turns into a stray,
it'll float up again, won't it?

219
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,340
There was a ceiling in the dungeon,

220
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,420
but if it floats up from here...

221
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,630
Yes, that's the thing.

222
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,600
We'll just have to run in
and grab it before it flies off.

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,220
So it's all up to chance, huh?

224
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,770
I wonder if there's anything I can do...

225
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,440
Any minute now, I think.

226
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,400
Time to grab my drop!

227
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,120
Nope, we're not done yet!

228
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,290
What the—?!

229
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,290
It might be lighter than air,

230
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,670
but it'll fall if it has
the weight of ice on it.

231
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,630
Amazing, Yoda!

232
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,190
The great artisan Orton's
latest magic cart is complete!

233
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,650
Take it with you.

234
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,820
No, no! We can't accept
such an expensive gift!

235
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,280
Don't say that.

236
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,150
I'm not giving you this
just because of what you did today.

237
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,990
Then, why?

238
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,240
You protected our town
the other day, remember?

239
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,080
The hero of Secro deserves
some kind of reward, I'd say.

240
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,420
Take good care of
my daddy's magic cart, okay?

241
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,050
You two...

242
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,760
It's a reward to you
for all your hard work.

243
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,180
A reward... I see.

244
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,680
I'll use it with all my gratitude!

245
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,980
TELULU LEVEL 4

246
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,270
All right.

247
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,990
Oops, looks like it's over capacity.

248
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,530
We've gathered over twice as many bamboo
shoots as usual thanks to the magic cart.

249
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,370
Man, this thing is incredibly handy!

250
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,660
Isn't it?

251
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,790
We must be grateful to Orton and Olga.

252
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,000
For sure.

253
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,590
I'm gonna run over to
Erza's place and sell her these.

254
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,010
Then I'll head home
and start making dinner.

255
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,140
Gimme a break!

256
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,560
Sir, as I've told you several times,
there's no mistake in this purchase—

257
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,440
Shut your mouth!

258
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,190
I brought enough to sell

259
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,150
- for more than 10,000 pilos!

260
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,020
- Can't someone stop him?
- for more than 10,000 pilos!

261
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,190
- Can't someone stop him?
- I bet you're lying about the price anyway!

262
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,940
- Not me. What if he tries
- I bet you're lying about the price anyway!

263
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,490
- to pick a fight with me next?
- C'mon, cough up the cash already!

264
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,030
I'm willing to accept 20,000 for my trouble.

265
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,500
I can't pay more than the list price of
8,400 pilos for what you've brought in.

266
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,870
What?!

267
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,670
You tryin' to go against
a customer's word?!

268
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,920
What the hell?!

269
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,430
You need to stop.

270
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,430
Ryota!

271
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,840
Who the hell are you?!

272
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,600
Erza wouldn't lie about the list price.

273
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,350
I'll prove it to you.

274
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,320
Check that out!
It's Orton's latest magic cart!

275
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,240
How does he have
so many bamboo shoots?

276
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,860
What the hell do you think you're doing?

277
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,170
Erza, how much is one of
these green onions worth?

278
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,630
Huh? It's 120 pilos.

279
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,790
Got it.

280
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,339
This magic cart was made
with rare monsters from Arsenic, right?

281
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,589
So it automatically detects
the weight of its contents

282
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,140
and calculates the total
amount they'll sell for.

283
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,310
8,400 pilos.

284
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,849
It sounds like the exact amount she quoted.

285
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,250
You're in with this shop
to run some scam, aren't you?!

286
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,400
I just happened to walk in here while you
were here. Do you think I could pull that off?

287
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,570
Shut up, you little bamboo shoot bastard!

288
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,500
I'll knock your ass off!

289
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,410
Ryota, watch out!

290
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,620
What?!

291
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,590
Sorry, but I'm gonna need
you to take a little nap.

292
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,720
Whoa!

293
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,510
He just saved her!

294
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,100
You had to bail me out again.

295
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,310
You don't need to worry about that.

296
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,810
But I will.

297
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,520
I'm an item trader.

298
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,990
All the items I sell here were gathered
at risk of life and limb by adventurers.

299
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,030
I'm obligated to handle them
with utmost care.

300
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,490
I want people to feel comfortable
bringing their goods here to sell to me.

301
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,580
But if I have to be helped
out all the time...

302
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,340
It's a bit more than even I can bear.

303
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,960
What's wrong with that?

304
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,710
Huh?

305
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,760
What's wrong with having help?

306
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,340
Everyone needs help.

307
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,470
You've helped me out a bunch, too.

308
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,560
No, really...

309
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,900
I haven't done anything special at all.

310
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,190
You always buy my items
from me with a smile.

311
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,110
You share your cheer with me.

312
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,030
Ryota...

313
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,780
And if anything like this happens again,
I want to protect you.

314
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,790
You scratch my back,
I scratch yours, right?

315
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,410
Right...

316
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,460
Of course, I feel like the help
you give me means a lot more...

317
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,560
Huh?! Um, Erza?!

318
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,140
That wasn't from me as an item trader.

319
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,730
That was a personal kiss from me.

320
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,820
Make sure you remember it, okay?

321
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,150
Well, I need to get back to work.

322
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,460
TELULU LEVEL 4

323
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:59,340
Before, the most we could make
in one haul was 20,000 pilos.

324
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,470
But now...

325
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,390
200,000?!

326
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,560
We could buy more than 6,000
bean sprouts with that!

327
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,570
With this much saved up...

328
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:15,360
We have enough for a new house!

329
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,000
I guess it's time to say
goodbye to this house.

330
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,920
It's a bit sad, isn't it?

331
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,630
Yeah.

332
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,300
I have lots of memories here.

333
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,510
Yes, and I learned just how nice it
is to have a place to come home to.

334
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,600
Yeah. Me, too.

335
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,100
20,000 pilos...

336
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,440
After killing slimes for three days,

337
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,360
we finally scraped together
20,000 pilos for rent.

338
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,070
It's no small amount, but...

339
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,820
Yoda?

340
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,620
Emily...

341
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,410
Let's keep our lease on this place.

342
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,870
That way we can come back home anytime,

343
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,420
even after we move to our new house.

344
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,800
Can we?
Wouldn't that be expensive, though?

345
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,300
I think the whole reason we've been
dungeon-diving to make money

346
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,720
was for a time just like this.

347
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,390
I want to use it to protect
the place that's precious to us.

348
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,270
Yoda...

349
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,950
Morning, Emily.

350
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,950
Good morning, Yoda!

351
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,620
Breakfast is ready.

352
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,290
You still make the best
breakfasts ever, Emily!

353
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,630
I think her carrot dishes
are the best, too.

354
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,290
When did you come in?!

355
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,130
Where there are carrots,
there are also rabbits.

356
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,970
I made lots, so it's no problem at all.

357
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,260
Sheesh... I guess that's that.

358
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,430
Let's eat!
