EPISODE 13: SON OF A LEGEND

2
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,790
My mother

3
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,160
will die soon.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,370
She wished to return

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
home.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,840
I've brought her back.

7
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,650
Our primary force
defeated the resistance in Wessex.

8
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,280
It is only a matter of time
before we control that region.

9
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:30,240
If things go smoothly,
we will have it before winter.

10
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,080
What happened

11
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,210
after London?

12
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,540
Canute.

13
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,340
Where is he now?

14
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,210
Yes.

15
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,180
Since the siege army
under the command of Prince Canute

16
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,510
was defeated by Thorkell's contingent,

17
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,510
His Highness's location has been unknown.

18
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,930
We've received news
of a battle in Marlborough,

19
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,900
and he may have joined the soldiers there.

20
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,440
Today, his well-being is uncertain.

21
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,280
He is my precious son.

22
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,870
Notify me as soon as you hear
anything about his status.

23
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,200
Understood!

24
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,010
-What the hell is this?
-We're surrounded!

25
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,010
Unbelievable!

26
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,480
What did I say? I knew this would happen!

27
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,020
Damn it.

28
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,770
Calm down, you bastards!

29
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,270
Listen to me.

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,820
Do not shoot back.

31
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,280
Do not engage them.

32
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,110
Messengers of Brycheiniog!

33
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,620
Your welcome party is a bit severe,
wouldn't you say?

34
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,250
So you can speak our language, barbarian?

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,750
I was told the Danes were such brutes
they didn't know how to speak.

36
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,130
Pull back your men!

37
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,130
Asser!

38
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,590
Antagonizing the Danes
will not benefit the Welsh!

39
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,050
Gratianus!

40
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,730
I respect your concern for the future
of all the kingdoms of Wales.

41
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,980
But our position is not the same as yours.

42
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,690
What agreement have you made
with the Danish prince?

43
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,570
They're nothing but barbarians!
We cannot reason with them!

44
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,780
What's that bastard screaming about?

45
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,660
I wish they'd decide
if we're fighting or not.

46
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,620
No.

47
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,370
There won't be a battle.

48
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,210
You know what he's saying, Bjorn?

49
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,790
Not a word.

50
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,750
However,

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,510
those arrows would have killed someone
if they wanted to fight.

52
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,760
They're trying to sway negotiations
in their favor with intimidation.

53
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,520
So that's what's happening.

54
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:03,400
We've paid closed attention
to your war with England.

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,190
In the last ten years,
you've agreed to a cease-fire three times

56
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,320
and each time broken that pact.

57
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,990
We will not repeat
the mistakes of England!

58
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,580
We will capture the prince
and use him as a shield.

59
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,290
Even the king of demons
should have some regard for his child.

60
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,090
Sorry, Askeladd.

61
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,630
No, it's all a charade.

62
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,180
They're putting on a show
to see how we'll respond.

63
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,260
Even the sheep must don
a wolf's coat to graze these days.

64
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,640
They have my sympathy.

65
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,150
Are you going
to share your plan with them?

66
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,610
That could work.

67
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,690
But if they want a show,

68
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,570
it may be interesting
to play along for a bit.

69
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,500
Men, look closely!

70
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,210
This lord before you

71
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,590
is the son of King Sweyn of Denmark!

72
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,130
Prince Canute!

73
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,590
The prince will now announce
what he wants you all to hear.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,050
Heed his words with respect!

75
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,060
Now, Your Highness,

76
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,140
say something with fervor.

77
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,560
Say anything at all.

78
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,610
Like, "We'll boil you alive!"

79
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,070
Give these impudent bastards
something to fear.

80
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,620
With your words, their balls will shrink
and we'll pass without hindrance.

81
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,380
Your Highness!

82
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,010
His Highness prefers
not to speak in front of others.

83
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,550
Here, I am--

84
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,390
No, Ragnar.

85
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,760
What?

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,180
No matter his young age,
as prince of Denmark,

87
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,640
he has a duty to fulfill.

88
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,100
All the men you see here

89
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,650
have come for the sake of His Highness.

90
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,940
He is of clement heart.

91
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,660
He is averse to needless quarrels.

92
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,620
That's what I'm saying!

93
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,410
To stop us from entering
a needless quarrel,

94
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm asking him to placate them.

95
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,540
If he never speaks up, how can he hope
to someday take the Danish throne?

96
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,460
Silence!

97
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,300
What do you know…

98
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,880
about the prince?

99
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,850
The palace is a den of wolves
where parents and kin devour each other.

100
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,100
The prince was of poor health
and had to endure tremendous trials.

101
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,310
He's remained quiet and unassuming,

102
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,610
never drawing attention to himself
to keep from getting killed.

103
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,740
Yet men like you, one after the other,

104
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,820
come crawling to use
His Highness in your schemes.

105
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,910
Know your place.

106
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,290
Try as you might to manipulate the prince,

107
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,630
I won't allow
the likes of you exploit him!

108
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,510
What's going on?

109
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,930
What's the disagreement?

110
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,850
What did Prince Canute say?

111
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,980
Gratianus.

112
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,610
I'm letting them in on the plan.

113
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,610
All right.

114
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,240
I will go with you.

115
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,740
Men, wait here.

116
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,580
I'm going to speak with the leader.

117
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,160
-As you say.
-All right.

118
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,710
Ragnar.

119
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,840
You're in the right.

120
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,300
I overstepped my bounds
in my concern for the prince.

121
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,890
Your Highness, I hope you can forgive me.

122
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,950
Pathetic.

123
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,660
How can we be the same age?

124
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,300
Did you say that man's name is Ragnar?

125
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,680
Yes.

126
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,800
Does he not know that fledglings
must eventually leave their nest?

127
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,020
His actions
are clearly harming that fledgling.

128
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,810
For this plan to succeed,
you have your work cut out for you.

129
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,190
You'll need to make
the baby bird fly his nest.

130
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
Yes.

131
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,030
I am aware.

132
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,830
Stop. I don't require an escort.

133
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,460
But…

134
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,500
Must I repeat myself?

135
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,680
It would disgrace the king if I couldn't
even negotiate without a guard.

136
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,390
Of course.

137
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,480
Keep walking!

138
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,690
Five times that distance!

139
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,600
Tell the others too!

140
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,480
Now then.

141
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,070
So you're Askeladd.

142
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,620
I understand your position,
but this puts a burden on me.

143
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,740
I thought we'd reached an agreement.

144
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,330
If you suddenly send letters asking
for both provisions and free passage,

145
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,000
you can't expect us
to agree to everything.

146
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:04,050
Our king is also young,
and it's important to keep up appearances.

147
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,140
I must weigh our options,
and decide how this can benefit us

148
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,230
and ensure that this transaction
is made on equal grounds.

149
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,600
My king doesn't want his subjects

150
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:19,230
to think he can be intimidated
by 100 Danes.

151
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,940
Certainly.

152
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,490
It doesn't look good for you
if you agree to all our demands.

153
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,280
I apologize for our imprudence.

154
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,910
I sent the request to your country.

155
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,080
I believe I said
that the details of your reward

156
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,040
wouldn't be explicit
for the sake of confidentiality.

157
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes, I read it.

158
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,880
Then let me ask now,

159
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,590
why all the secrecy?

160
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,350
Before that…

161
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,890
depending on the details of the reward,

162
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,400
what is the chance
you will enter the war, Asser?

163
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,440
Please, don't mock me.

164
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,240
I know full well that our small country

165
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,410
wouldn't stand a chance
if we angered the Danish king.

166
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,540
Pardon me.

167
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,290
I just wanted to make certain.

168
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,830
That man is full of mystery.

169
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Who is?

170
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,920
Our Askeladd.

171
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,630
I had no idea he spoke Welsh.

172
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,810
You're the closest to him
and even you don't know everything.

173
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,810
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't know anything about him.

174
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,060
All I know is that he's from Denmark.

175
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,070
He keeps his distance.

176
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,150
Over ten years together,
and he's never talked about himself.

177
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,280
Are you pouting
in that giant body of yours?

178
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,530
Shut up. You picking a fight?

179
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,870
Come on. Don't get worked up.

180
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,750
It's fine.

181
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,620
He's a good leader.

182
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,790
And he's lucky.

183
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,540
As long as he gets us the money,

184
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,460
I'll follow him
no matter what his story is.

185
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,810
That's very hard to believe.

186
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,270
But even if it were a lie…

187
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,730
He is the son of Lydia,
a direct descendant.

188
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,820
The man standing before you

189
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,150
has the blood of our great
Roman-Celtic leaders running through him.

190
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,910
So you're saying, you're not a Dane?

191
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,910
I am both Welsh and Danish.

192
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,630
My father, Olaf,
once plundered the coasts of Wales,

193
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,920
and there, took a mistress, Lydia.

194
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,380
I was born as a result.

195
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,760
I thought the Old Britannia
line of war heroes had died out.

196
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,390
You're saying…

197
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,480
you're the descendant of Artorius?

198
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,940
Artorius.

199
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,360
Between the 5th and 6th centuries,

200
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,320
he commanded the armies of Britannia,
nation of the indigenous Celts of Britain.

201
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,580
In the year 516 AD,

202
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,370
he fought the Saxons,
who became the English,

203
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,960
and fought back the invaders
at the Battle of Badon Hill,

204
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,170
bringing peace to Britannia.

205
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,260
He became the source

206
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,550
of the legend of King Arthur,
retold by generations ever since.

207
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,220
What reliable proof

208
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,270
do you have to support your claim?

209
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,810
Myself.

210
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,650
When he was 14 years old,

211
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,070
I met him and Lady Lydia
for the first time when he came to Wales.

212
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,830
She was an unlucky woman.

213
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,130
She was imprisoned in my father's bedroom.

214
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,170
When she fell ill,
she was moved to a horse stable.

215
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,380
That is tragic.

216
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,680
Considering…

217
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,680
that the last scion of a great bloodline

218
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,140
is also part Danish…

219
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,350
That is the point, Asser.

220
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,770
As a result of my dual heritage…

221
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,270
I can pass for one of the Danes.

222
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:37,070
In other words,
there is a Welsh spy in the Danish army.

223
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,240
If I ensure the fledgling prince
is the next king of Denmark,

224
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,950
I will gain political influence.

225
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,250
Once I have that,

226
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,790
I can convince them to sign
a non-aggression pact with Wales.

227
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,720
I will prevent them

228
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,680
from stepping one foot onto this land.

229
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,900
I mean no offense,
but that is quite ambitious!

230
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,320
How can you make such a bold promise?

231
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,160
Asser is laughing.

232
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,160
He is truly a brave man.

233
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,290
I have one concern.

234
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,380
Having been born and raised
among the Danes,

235
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,670
how do we know the blood of Lord Artorius
is stronger than your Danish blood?

236
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,640
You'll have to take my word for it.

237
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,310
But despite my heritage…

238
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,440
I hate

239
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,690
the Danes.

240
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,610
-Swords over here.
-Is nothing left?

241
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Make sure you give it back.

242
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,740
Not this one.

243
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,660
There's no way I'm giving up my sword.

244
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,380
While we pass through this country,
we must act like we're their prisoners.

245
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,010
Once we're out of the country,
the weapons will be returned.

246
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,840
That way, they can save face.

247
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,680
I can't help wondering.

248
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,890
Why are your men
so eager to carry out your orders?

249
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,850
Amazing, isn't it?

250
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,690
Just goes to show
how much my men trust me.

251
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,190
Hey, Thorfinn, you too.

252
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,570
Not a chance, geezer.

253
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,820
Trust, huh?

254
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,410
This one is different.

255
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,830
Damn punk.

256
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,330
Make no mistake, conehead.

257
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm not one of this geezer's men.

258
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,210
I'm his enemy.

259
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,790
Enemy?

260
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,920
All right, fine.
You can keep your weapons.

261
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,170
Surely, they can overlook two people.

262
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,090
All right!

263
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,100
Resume marching!

264
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,350
Are those the Danes?

265
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,480
It looks like Asser has captured them!

266
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,160
-My god.
-Aren't they cannibals?

267
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,740
-Their faces…
-Are those horns?

268
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:33,250
I knew Asser could do it!

269
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,580
I'm throwing a rock.

270
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,750
Don't, you fool!

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,290
They're pissing me off.

272
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,260
Do they take us for fantastic beasts?

273
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,010
Don't stare at us, you bastards!

274
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,090
We'll devour you!

275
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,980
Quit gawking at me, Princess.

276
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,400
Use your mouth to say what you want.

277
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,280
Or have you lost your tongue?

278
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,410
I am…

279
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
I keep silent but not because I am

280
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,210
a coward.

281
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm just being cautious.

282
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,090
I have… to be.

283
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,300
I am a prince.

284
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,970
I'm…

285
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,850
not like you.

286
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,730
The words I say
have great political bearing…

287
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,020
all the more in this foreign land.

288
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,320
Without my father's sanction…

289
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,780
I cannot enter non-aggression pacts
or make dangerous statements.

290
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,570
Of course I can't!

291
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,170
I am

292
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,500
merely prudent.

293
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,960
That's not a bad excuse.

294
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,300
But you seem to lack the brains, Princess.

295
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,850
You insolent swine!

296
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,390
This is the first time
anyone has shown me such disrespect!

297
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,190
Then it's a learning experience.

298
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,690
Take back your words!

299
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,230
I'm silent for good reason!

300
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,990
You've no idea
what it means to be a royal!

301
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,200
Stop whining and sit down.

302
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,240
I am not whining!

303
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,530
I'm making sure my words are understood.

304
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,200
Yeah, loud and clear.

305
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,080
How dare you act with such impudence!

306
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,460
His Highness

307
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,630
is speaking to someone other than me!

308
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,960
Snow.

309
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,600
Askeladd!

310
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,020
Can we go faster?

311
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,100
At this rate, we'll be snowed in!

312
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,980
For pity's sake.

313
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,730
Does he ever shut up?

314
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,780
We'll cross northern Mercia, then reunite
with the main force in Gainsborough.

315
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,070
We'll arrive in about a week.

316
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,290
We're passing through enemy land.

317
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,000
If we're snowed in
among the Welsh mountains,

318
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,170
we'll be trapped.

319
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Calm down.

320
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,420
There's no need to worry.

321
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,670
We're far from the enemy stronghold.

322
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,920
But how will we procure provisions?

323
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,300
I doubt these feudal lords
will show much hospitality to Danes.

324
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,220
It'll be fine.

325
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:19,220
I've taken that into account.

326
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,610
Men, we're changing course!

327
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,190
Don't fall behind!

328
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,610
What?

329
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,530
Seriously?

330
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,200
-We're changing routes?
-Are you sure?

331
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,860
Do not doubt!

332
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,700
Askeladd's judgment is not wrong.

333
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,520
