1
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:22,543
Killing a Devil handled by civilians
can be deemed as

2
00:00:22,626 --> 00:00:23,960
an obstruction to business.

3
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:26,460
You can get arrested for that.

4
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:31,418
Think twice before you act, Power.

5
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,710
You need to keep an eye on her, Denji.

6
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,835
What? Me?

7
00:00:36,918 --> 00:00:40,751
Power was a Blood Devil
before becoming a Fiend.

8
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,585
She's good with blood manipulation.

9
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:46,168
But she gets too excited sometimes.

10
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,835
Maybe she's not suited
to be a Devil Hunter after all.

11
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:50,835
He…

12
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:54,418
He forced me to kill it…

13
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,543
What?

14
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,168
What are you saying? That's a blatant lie.

15
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:00,793
I'm not lying.

16
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:04,210
I told you.
This human asked me to kill the Devil.

17
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:05,126
It's true.

18
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,043
Wow. What?

19
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:10,293
Ms. Makima, this Devil is lying.

20
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:14,418
Arrest her. They'll arrest you for lying.

21
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:16,793
It was he who asked me to do it.

22
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:20,710
Devils don't lie. Only humans do.

23
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:22,668
That's not true.

24
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:26,168
You just proved it, you idiot. Liar.

25
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:30,751
Humans are dirty liars.
You told me to do it.

26
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:33,335
How dare you lie about me?
Pretentious bastard.

27
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:34,543
You're disgusting.

28
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,543
Can you be quiet?

29
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:40,960
Y… Yes.

30
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,501
Good girl, Power.

31
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:49,668
To be honest, I don't care who's the drag.

32
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,918
I want to see your capabilities.

33
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:56,085
Can you two show it to me?

34
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:58,918
Y… Yes.

35
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:29,001
Looks like I can't get distracted
by breasts now.

36
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:50,710
For me, even drinking this is
like a dream.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
But if I make another mistake,

38
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:57,793
the consequence will be
much more serious than not getting drinks.

39
00:02:58,835 --> 00:03:02,168
But I still don't want
to work with a liar.

40
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:07,335
Only cats get along with me.

41
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,168
I hate humans.

42
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,668
Not because they did something to me.

43
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,668
It's more like a Devil's instinct.

44
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,251
I hate Devils just as much.

45
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:22,876
That's because they took away my Meowy.

46
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:28,918
Makima caught me
before I could get Meowy back.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,085
It could be dead now,

48
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,460
but I just can't give it up.

49
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,085
As long as I can get it back
from the Devil,

50
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:39,460
I'll do anything, even help humans.

51
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:43,876
You probably despise cats
and don't understand how I feel.

52
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,710
Cats? Boring.

53
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:51,626
I'll do anything
to touch some boobs though.

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,335
I just knew humans couldn't understand me.

55
00:03:58,668 --> 00:03:59,585
Oh, yeah.

56
00:04:00,376 --> 00:04:02,835
I probably could if it were a dog.

57
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,543
If you save Meowy from the Devil,
you can touch my boobs. How's that?

58
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,668
Dirty Devil.

59
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,793
How dare it kidnap your cat?

60
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,251
How can I let such a thing happen?

61
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,543
As a Devil Hunter, I won't forgive that.

62
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:35,043
I'll kill that filthy Devil.

63
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,793
CHAINSAW MAN

64
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:13,001
<i>Power's request to go out is permitted.</i>

65
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:17,501
Please come back before 1700H.

66
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,501
You can't go out alone?

67
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:21,418
That's right.

68
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,043
It's so boring to be kept in here.

69
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,876
I know where the Devil that took Meowy is.

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,626
But only you can fight it.

71
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:49,543
That Devil would take Meowy hostage
whenever it sees me.

72
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,835
I can't do anything.

73
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,585
I once had a Devil called Pochita.

74
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:02,876
I can't stroke it anymore.

75
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,876
But it's okay.

76
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,751
Because it still lives here.

77
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:09,543
Humans are stupid.

78
00:07:09,626 --> 00:07:10,626
What?

79
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,418
You mean Pochita is dead, right?

80
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,668
Being dead means it's no longer alive.

81
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,876
All the nonsense
about it living in your heart

82
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,126
is just self-consolation.

83
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:30,418
Yeah, you're right.

84
00:07:36,293 --> 00:07:38,918
<i>Never in a million years…</i>

85
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,960
<i>would I get along with her.</i>

86
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,251
Because of that affair with America,

87
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:53,793
the radicals in the USSR are
getting more and more advocates.

88
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,751
There are even rumors of
using Devils for military purposes.

89
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:03,543
I hope that Devils will be
the only enemies of Japan.

90
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,793
Makima.

91
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:08,168
How are the dogs in your division?

92
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,126
There's one that can probably
match up to your expectations.

93
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:13,335
An interesting one.

94
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,293
How?

95
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,460
A dog I just picked up from the street.

96
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:23,168
Your job is to train the dogs
and give them orders.

97
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:26,793
Do not get attached.

98
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,835
Denji is annoying.
He's not interesting at all.

99
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,293
Why do you hold
such high expectations of him?

100
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,543
All Devils were born with names.

101
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,376
The scarier the name is,

102
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,876
the more powerful it is.

103
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:16,668
Take "coffee" as an example.

104
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,835
It has nothing to do with being scary.

105
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:22,085
If there's a "Coffee Devil,"
it must be a weak one.

106
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,293
But what about a "Car Devil"?

107
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,918
It makes you think of
being run over by a car.

108
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,126
Could be a strong one.

109
00:09:33,335 --> 00:09:36,793
Denji can turn into a "Chainsaw Devil."

110
00:09:38,793 --> 00:09:40,710
I think it's quite interesting.

111
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:48,085
Just interesting. He's of no use to us.

112
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:53,668
Everyone in the Public Safety Sector
has a goal or faith.

113
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:57,918
But he said he has neither of those.

114
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,918
He's not cut out for this place.

115
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,751
Not to mention,
he thinks he can befriend Devils.

116
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:07,335
He's just a kid.

117
00:10:07,918 --> 00:10:09,001
Unfledged.

118
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:23,918
That house over there.

119
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,376
The Devil and Meowy are in it.

120
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:30,043
I see…

121
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,460
Let's go then.

122
00:10:40,168 --> 00:10:43,251
I don't want to turn into a chainsaw.
I'd lose too much blood.

123
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:45,918
Chainsaw?

124
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,918
Yeah, I can turn into a chainsaw.

125
00:10:49,543 --> 00:10:51,876
Humans make terrible jokes.

126
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,835
-What?
-What's the matter?

127
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:02,751
Didn't you say the Devil will take
your cat hostage if it sees you?

128
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,960
You shouldn't get too close to it.

129
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,460
Oh, I forgot.

130
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,960
Forgot?

131
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:13,710
I made a mistake.

132
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,710
Being stupid is one thing.

133
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,710
You have a sharp intuition.

134
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:02,085
You made me wait so long, Blood Devil.

135
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:04,418
I thought you had run away.

136
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,835
Stop griping.

137
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:08,918
It's not easy for me to get out.

138
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:12,085
As you wish, I brought a human.

139
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:13,668
Bat.

140
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,043
The food I've missed for so long.

141
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:25,043
A young male? I can't wait
for the vigor in his blood.

142
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,001
Human, look at the wound on my wrist.

143
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:37,418
It's all your fault, human.

144
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:42,876
I had to hide here for so long
because of this wound.

145
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,626
I didn't do anything, idiot.

146
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,626
How dare you talk back?

147
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:53,710
The wound caused by humans
shall be healed by human blood.

148
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:01,668
It tastes awful!

149
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:09,460
How dare you try to heal me
with this awful blood?

150
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,876
The taste in my mouth is disgusting.

151
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,460
I need other humans' blood
to get rid of it.

152
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:31,460
Are you here to get along with the Devils?

153
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,460
I didn't expect you to believe me.

154
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:46,126
Humans are fools.

155
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,085
<i>The smell of cigarettes.</i>

156
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,335
<i>Cosmetics and medicines.</i>

157
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,085
-Really?
-I know.

158
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,168
The smell is not that bad.

159
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:09,085
I'll try a child this time.

160
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,126
Bat Devil.

161
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:15,251
I brought you a human as we agreed.

162
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:17,918
Give me back my Meowy.

163
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,668
I forgot about that.

164
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,668
Meowy.

165
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:35,168
You brought me terrible blood.
It's time for your punishment.

166
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:40,751
Meowy…

167
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,501
Meowy.

168
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:44,793
I'll call you Meowy from now on.

169
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:47,751
You smell delicious for a cat.

170
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:54,585
Look how thin you are.

171
00:14:55,835 --> 00:14:58,751
I'll eat you when you get fatter.

172
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:10,835
So get bigger.

173
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,626
I can't wait to kill you.

174
00:15:24,126 --> 00:15:27,710
I used to kill every living thing I saw.

175
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:33,293
It feels amazing to hear
something other than cries.

176
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,376
It's unbelievable.

177
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,043
Blood Devil.

178
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,293
I need blood.

179
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,543
Bring a human to me

180
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,626
if you want this cat alive.

181
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:16,168
You said you can't touch Pochita anymore.

182
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:20,168
I understand how you feel now.

183
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:23,335
It's terrible.

184
00:16:32,126 --> 00:16:35,585
Awful. All I drank was awful blood.

185
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:43,001
The taste in my mouth is sickening.

186
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,251
I need a child's blood to clean it.

187
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:55,501
Then a maiden for an appetizer.

188
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:58,501
A fat male for the main course.

189
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,501
And a pregnant woman for dessert.

190
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,293
Give me back the boobs!

191
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:12,293
You're drinking my blood? Gross!

192
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,710
I don't want your awful blood near me!

193
00:17:18,376 --> 00:17:20,543
<i>One time, Pochita went missing.</i>

194
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,876
<i>I didn't see him when I woke up.</i>

195
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:27,210
<i>And there was no sight of him in town.</i>

196
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:31,293
<i>I thought he had been eaten by a Devil.</i>

197
00:17:33,376 --> 00:17:34,293
<i>But when I got home,</i>

198
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:37,251
<i>I saw Pochita waiting for me, crying.</i>

199
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:41,543
<i>I was so relieved
and fell asleep with him.</i>

200
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,460
<i>After the Devil took her cat…</i>

201
00:17:48,043 --> 00:17:50,210
<i>What was it like for her to go to sleep?</i>

202
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:05,501
You're a Devil?

203
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,668
Idiot! Do you want to get eaten?

204
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,001
You're telling humans to run away?

205
00:18:39,668 --> 00:18:43,085
What kind of Devil are you?
What do you want?

206
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,085
I want to slash your stomach

207
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,751
and touch some boobs!

208
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:32,918
Run!

209
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:45,668
Coward! You let humans run away!

210
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:50,168
Will you saw this one too?

211
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,793
The chainsaw can retract.

212
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:59,293
A great strength that
doesn't match your body.

213
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,335
Why do you use that strength
to save humans?

214
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,543
"Save"? Who?

215
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:11,668
He's a guy.

216
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,751
What do I care?

217
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
I shall use you to heal my wounds.

218
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:50,668
Your blood has the smell of cigarettes,
but I'll have to make do with you for now.

219
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:57,085
Why are you still alive?

220
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:02,710
I've gone through so much pain…

221
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,835
to be where I am now.

222
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,876
But I haven't even…

223
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:17,751
touched one boob!

224
00:21:31,626 --> 00:21:34,335
D-Don't come over here!

225
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:53,668
CHAINSAW MAN
