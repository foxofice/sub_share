1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,440
Yeah that's nice!

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,280
Good to wash the fleas and lice out!

3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,070
Don't just sulk in the corner.
Come over here.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,200
If you fall overboard,
a sea serpent will eat you!

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,420
-What?
-He's ignoring us?

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,790
What a bore.

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,880
In the Middle Ages,

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,470
some of the Danes living in Denmark,

9
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,470
the pirates who pillaged and plundered
as an occupation,

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,890
were called "Vikings."

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,980
For these men,

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,570
England held the abundant,
wide-open lands that they yearned for.

13
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,990
In the beginning of the 9th century,
Vikings invaded England,

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,910
and some settled north in England,
which expanded their influence.

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,920
However, in 1002 A.D.,

16
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,920
the English Army attacked
the Vikings settlers.

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,930
In response, the Danish Army
sent ships to take revenge on England

18
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,430
and moved in for a direct attack.

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,690
By joining this political cause,

20
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,490
the Vikings took it upon themselves
to fight in a war of revenge

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,070
against the English Army.

22
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,920
EPISODE 6: THE JOURNEY BEGINS

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,510
Put your backs into!

24
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,880
Move your arms!

25
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,930
Shut up!

26
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,180
What do you think I'm doing!

27
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,060
Oh, dear.
Whoever did this wasn't very tidy.

28
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,190
All right. This spot looks good.

29
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,150
Stop the boat!

30
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,070
CENTRAL ENGLAND, NEAR GAINSBOROUGH

31
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,370
Man, it's hard to walk around here.

32
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,160
And the stench is awful.

33
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Damn it.

34
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,440
These guys aren't normal soldiers, right?

35
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,150
They were hired
by the Danish Army like us.

36
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,780
The Danish Army?

37
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,030
The Vikings have a hand in the war?

38
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,750
They're starting skirmishes
with the English Army here and there.

39
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,960
Vikings are spectacular tools of war.

40
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,170
At any rate, the Danish king
plans to invade England.

41
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,550
Years could pass in the meantime,
but this is the groundwork.

42
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,430
So they're clearing out
anyone who could get in the way.

43
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,850
Before the king arrives.

44
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,560
That's right. And if we help out…

45
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,690
the rewards will be bountiful.

46
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,870
So many insects here.

47
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,370
It's better than sitting in the cold.
Now is the time we make our fortune.

48
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,210
How about it? Not a bad deal.

49
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,050
The feudal lord of this land
has been burdened by the English Army.

50
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,680
We're an army of over 100 men.

51
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,140
And frankly, we're superior
to you in a fight.

52
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,730
That's a big mouth for a common pirate.

53
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,690
There's no need for that.

54
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,070
We're all Danes here.

55
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,940
Don't compare yourself to me.

56
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,370
What's that supposed to mean?

57
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,330
Come now. In a few years,
there's gonna be an invasion, right?

58
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,000
In which case, you better
take a few preliminary measures.

59
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
None of your soldiers would have to die.

60
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,380
What do you want in return?

61
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,470
Seven pounds of gold.

62
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,970
The treasure and food
of the lord of the land.

63
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,810
And we take all the women.

64
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,560
Five pounds. Then do as you wish.

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,780
Then it's settled! End of negotiation.

66
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,950
What's that all about?

67
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,490
We've been given a job.

68
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,120
All right! Better eat up then!

69
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,670
Tomorrow, we will send an official envoy.

70
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,880
We'll leave the war plans to you,
but don't go running off.

71
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
You'll have nowhere to retreat.

72
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,430
If you try to deceive--

73
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,640
We're surrounded?

74
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,190
-You didn't hear them?
-You're noisy!

75
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Shoot!

76
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,400
Get down!

77
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,910
My ass is hit!

78
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
This is perfect for my digestion.

79
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,000
I'll kill you!

80
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,500
Beat them at their own game!

81
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,880
Shoot!

82
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,100
Damn it!

83
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,780
Accomplish something on the battlefield.

84
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,570
Once you do,

85
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,660
I'll reward you with a duel.

86
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,200
Accomplish something.

87
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,170
Brat!

88
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,920
You a pirate too?

89
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,310
If you must hate someone, hate the Danes.

90
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,950
Excuse me. You still alive?

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,580
The weak will die on the battlefield.

92
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,960
Like you.

93
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,460
Damn it.

94
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,770
Little punk!

95
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,150
Die!

96
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,210
Get over here!

97
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,680
You're starting to look like a warrior.

98
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,020
Hey, Thorfinn.

99
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,940
Could you be our spy for a while?

100
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,030
What? Why should I?

101
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,090
Boy! How dare you!

102
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,300
Hold him down. I'll kill him!

103
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,040
There he is!

104
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,500
Over there!

105
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,850
That way! Don't let him escape!

106
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,960
Don't you wish
our king was a little less foolish?

107
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,090
Mother! You can't say such things aloud!

108
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,050
Two generations ago,
King Edgar was a good king.

109
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,260
He got along with the Danes.

110
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,100
Everyone respected him.

111
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,230
That king was a fine Christian.

112
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,690
But His Majesty
King Ethelred will ruin us all.

113
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,950
He killed all the Danish settlers
living in this country.

114
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,030
Of course they're angry.

115
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,870
Mother, you shouldn't say
such things in front of others.

116
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,500
What if a soldier hears you?

117
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,840
Mother!

118
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,000
Mother, wait!

119
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,220
YEAR 1008 A.D.
EASTERN ENGLAND, EAST ANGLIA

120
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,790
Oh, you're awake.

121
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,840
We were just about to have supper.

122
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,050
How is your injury?

123
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,800
We've washed your clothes.

124
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,050
Wear that for now.

125
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,350
Your dagger is there, too.

126
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,900
The clothes may fit a little big.

127
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,110
But they're all the boy clothes we have.

128
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,650
Now, have a seat.
You must be hungry, right?

129
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,170
He seems famished.

130
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,260
What is your name?

131
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,050
Where did you come from?

132
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,590
What happened to your parents?

133
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,850
See? He doesn't understand our language.

134
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,100
-He might be Danish.
-What are you saying?

135
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,070
No matter who he is,
you can't just leave an injured child.

136
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,980
Jesus wouldn't forgive you.

137
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,740
But the Danes are
enemies of England, aren't they?

138
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,240
Father was conscripted
because of the Danish invasion.

139
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,960
And what of it?

140
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,960
There is no reason women and children
should participate in the wars of men.

141
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,130
As true as that may be…

142
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,270
This child has fleas!

143
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,270
Stop scratching!

144
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,110
They're getting in the food!

145
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,990
See?

146
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,990
Don't you feel better?

147
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,950
Goodness. Boys sure are so grubby.

148
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,920
My youngest was always scratching too.

149
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,750
So I would comb his hair every time.

150
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,340
Two years ago,
he caught a disease and died.

151
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,520
I don't understand
the language you're speaking.

152
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,900
But I'm not an Englishman.

153
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,950
What's this?

154
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,320
So your mouth does work!

155
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,590
Woman!

156
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,130
Yes? What is your business?

157
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,640
A Danish spy is hiding in these parts.
Have you seen any suspicious kids?

158
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,100
A kid?

159
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,140
A pirate child?

160
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,230
Don't be fooled.

161
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,230
He managed to kill
two of His Excellency's men.

162
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,270
There's a wound on his left arm.

163
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,660
Woman.

164
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,210
Is that your son?

165
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,120
Yes, that's right.

166
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,960
My youngest son, John. Is there a problem?

167
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,510
The child is just about his age.

168
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,550
If you see him, report it!

169
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,650
Do you realize what you're doing?

170
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,400
That boy is a pirate!

171
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,070
Despite being a child
he's apparently killed two people!

172
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,910
Why are you hiding him?

173
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,990
It's not normal
for a child to be a pirate.

174
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,160
There must be a reason for it.

175
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,920
What reason? Whatever it is
this isn't the time to find out.

176
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,920
That boy won't replace John.

177
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,390
I'm going to the soldiers to…

178
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,530
Run.

179
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,320
Run away.

180
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,700
Wait a moment!

181
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,540
John!

182
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,470
-Do you see Thorfinn's signal?
-It should come soon.

183
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,970
I see it!

184
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:34,680
There it is!

185
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,900
Fire!

186
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,740
The shore hut is on fire!

187
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,200
Gather the men!

188
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,240
Hurry!

189
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,740
Bring buckets!

190
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,380
So it was you!

191
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,930
So you disguised yourself!

192
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:18,980
What?

193
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,270
What is that?

194
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,990
That's awful.

195
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,130
Damn it!

196
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,040
Who is this child?

197
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,380
Did he kill them?

198
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,150
Why are you here? I told you to run!

199
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,900
I said it properly in English!

200
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,150
He's coming this way!

201
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,280
You can still make it!
Escape to the forest!

202
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,910
Get far away from the sea!
If you don't hurry, they'll--

203
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,000
Hey, what is that?

204
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,010
No!

205
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,930
Run!

206
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,730
Forget the fire!

207
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,940
Everyone, run!

208
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,610
Vikings!

209
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,750
Well done, Thorfinn.

210
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,040
This village is livelier than I expected.

211
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,580
Don't waste time!

212
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,750
Clear this place out
before the army arrives!

213
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
