1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,190
In the 11th century, the invasion
of the Danish army and the Vikings

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,520
only continued to intensify.

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,990
1012 A.D. ENGLAND

4
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,290
Then in October,

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,790
after years of continuous assaults,

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,040
a turning point was reached.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,300
ESTATE OF KING SWEYN
NEAR JELLING, DENMARK

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,380
Then you wish to withdraw
our soldiers from England?

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,300
Not withdraw. Let them rest.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,020
Marching in winter
will deplete our military strength.

11
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,980
And our soldiers abroad
need to recuperate.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,940
Yes, as you wish.

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,400
The summer.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,780
We will launch a major attack next summer.

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,160
I, too, shall lead an army into battle.

16
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,090
So we have a break all of a sudden?

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,300
I want to go home.

18
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:21,380
There's no need for the pirates either.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,310
I thought we could earn a lot this year.

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,600
The regimented soldiers
aren't moving either.

21
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,770
This is what it means to work for hire.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,030
What will Askeladd do?

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,820
Askeladd.

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,540
If this keeps up,
winter's gonna be awfully hard.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,830
And we've ransacked all the good villages.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,460
That's true.

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,960
What do you plan to do?

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,340
We'll do as we must.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,090
We'll migrate like the birds.

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,430
We'll go where the food is.

31
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,950
NEAR THE LOIRE RIVER,
KINGDOM OF FRANCE

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,030
Move it!

33
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,790
They've got a ram!

34
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,460
Gather the crossbows!

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,000
One, two…

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,420
Shoot in two groups!

37
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,340
Ready!

38
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,050
Shoot!

39
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,480
It's no use! Retreat!

40
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,830
Looks like the Franks
are having a skirmish?

41
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,460
There are few men in the fortress,
while the offense has 800.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,300
I can't believe they're
sieging through the front.

43
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,300
So this is a clan base?

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,140
What do you think?

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,720
Doesn't it smell of treasure?

46
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,680
So that's your aim?

47
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,770
Shall we do it, Askeladd?

48
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,230
We'll side with the attackers.

49
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,150
We'll break open their treasury
and take what's inside.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,700
All right!

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,030
I was wondering what we were doing
in the middle of nowhere.

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,620
Askeladd comes through!

53
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,330
Our leader's judgment is never wrong!

54
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,460
We'll regain what we lost in England!

55
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,370
Thorfinn.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,380
You're up.

57
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,100
Time to fight.

58
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,330
EPISODE 7: PARTNER IN WAR

59
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,290
Time to fight.

60
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,870
Contact the attacking side's leader.

61
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,750
Tell him this:

62
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,380
"You're terrible in battle.
Watching you is unbearable.

63
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,590
Thus, our contingent is here to help.

64
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,140
We're a once-in-a-lifetime godsend.

65
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,560
We will surely guide you to victory.

66
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,850
If the fortress falls,
we will take half the spoils.

67
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,110
We can join the attack tomorrow morning."

68
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,610
After delivering the message,
stick around to see the reaction.

69
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,990
Then leave.

70
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,370
What's wrong?

71
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,450
Go, Thorfinn.

72
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,460
How many do you think I've killed so far?

73
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,880
I've been your scout
and support from the rear.

74
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,390
I've accomplished enough.

75
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,930
Yet…

76
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,560
you…

77
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,520
What?

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,270
You want a reward?

79
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,780
Once you've reached an agreement,
I'll give you three gold coins.

80
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,610
I swear to the God Tyr.

81
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,530
Don't mess with me.

82
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
How long will you evade me?

83
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,950
You're scary!

84
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,000
I was only teasing.

85
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,330
However…

86
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,500
in that case, you'll have to bring me
at least one helmeted head.

87
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,100
He never changes.

88
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,100
Is it wise to task him
with important negotiations?

89
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,150
Inferior soldiers can get nervous.

90
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,730
They're often killed
before negotiations even begin.

91
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,150
Who'd bother with a stray like him?

92
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,830
What do you want, kid?

93
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,960
This is no place for a child!

94
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,460
I'm an envoy.

95
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,170
Does anyone here speak Norse?

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,880
What's with this kid?

97
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,630
What language is that?

98
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,090
He's not a Frank.

99
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,850
A spy from the fortress?

100
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,890
We'll just take him.

101
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,190
I am an envoy.

102
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,900
Is there anyone who speaks Norse?

103
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,570
Give you half the spoils?

104
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
These mercenaries are pushing their luck!

105
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,910
"Give you half the spoils…"

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,080
You're very confident, aren't you?

107
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,420
You Norman brat.

108
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Norman?

109
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,720
The northerners who attacked England?

110
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,840
"The northerners who attacked…"

111
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,600
Your strategy is obvious.

112
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,270
If you just attack the front gate,
your men will only die.

113
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,350
Defense around the lake is light.

114
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,190
That's where we would target.

115
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,360
That's ill-advised.

116
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,280
The rivers flowing
into the lake are treacherous

117
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,740
not to mention the waterfalls.

118
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,660
Our ships were wiped out going downstream.

119
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,870
That's what it means
to attack from the lake.

120
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,540
"That's what it means to attack…"

121
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
Do you

122
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,500
refuse our offer?

123
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,130
In that case, Askeladd's 100 men
will side with the fortress.

124
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,670
"…side with the fortress."

125
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,380
My death won't change that.

126
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,140
If I don't signal
the end of our negotiations,

127
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,890
you will make an enemy
of 100 of the north's fiercest fighters.

128
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,480
Fine.

129
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,520
Your Excellency!

130
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:55,610
However,

131
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,280
if we learn your words are false,
we will chop your head!

132
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,190
If you are sincere,

133
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,410
in the name of Jesus Christ,
we will equally share our bread.

134
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,580
"…we will equally share our bread."

135
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,370
Return my dagger to me.

136
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,960
It is a memento of my father.

137
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,980
That's Thorfinn's signal.

138
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,350
One high arrow, two low.

139
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,230
Let's hurry.

140
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,280
We'll pass over the ridge
before the moon rises.

141
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,660
We've been guarding
the ship this whole time.

142
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,030
I want to fight too.

143
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,410
Damn that fat general.

144
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,830
Over there.

145
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,340
Dragon!

146
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,880
On the mountain!

147
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,730
A dragon…

148
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,490
A dragon climbed the mountain?

149
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,530
Yes.

150
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,990
A report said
all the ship's guards saw it last night.

151
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,280
It's an omen, Your Excellency.

152
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,870
I'd like to see one someday.

153
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,130
Brat.

154
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,380
Are your comrades coming?

155
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,710
"I'd like to see…"

156
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,130
The sun is already high.

157
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,590
"The sun is already high."

158
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,510
Just start the assault, fatty.

159
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,140
You'll soon see.

160
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,430
You just insulted me now, didn't you?

161
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,400
It seems tonight's entertainment
will be your beheading.

162
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,860
Advance!

163
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,860
Advance!

164
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,080
Advance!

165
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,630
Charge!

166
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Oh, no. It's already started.

167
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,140
We're late, you bastards!

168
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,980
Give it all you've got!

169
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,140
The battlefield is waiting!

170
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,030
It's the same as last time!

171
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,030
Damn it.

172
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,030
Put a ladder up on the west side!

173
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,780
Sacrifice as many as needed!

174
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,620
Hey. Which one is the opposition leader?

175
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,210
You see the one
with feathers in his helmet?

176
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,790
That's him.

177
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,300
"A helmeted head."

178
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,350
Hey, you!

179
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,890
You lied to me, didn't you?

180
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:15,850
Kill him!

181
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,850
Kill the brat!

182
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,360
You bastard!

183
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,730
He escaped, and the fortress won't fall!

184
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,110
What's wrong with this army?

185
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,610
You think I'll let you
go home if it snows?

186
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,910
But I won't!

187
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,120
Not until you take that fortress!

188
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,630
Huh?

189
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,010
Heave-ho!

190
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,650
Row!

191
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,190
Full speed ahead!

192
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,190
-Aye!
-Aye!

193
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,450
First to arrive gets twice the payment!

194
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,950
Put everything into it!

195
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,200
I see!

196
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,790
They're on our side!

197
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,710
Everyone advance! Take the fortress!

198
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,460
They carried their ship over the ridge.

199
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,210
Don't waver!

200
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,050
The 80 men on the right, go to the harbor!

201
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,090
Crossbows, come with me!

202
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,020
You're ill-prepared!

203
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,030
The lake is not only a poor bulwark,
but it's also a perfect entry point.

204
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,530
All right! Head straight in!

205
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,670
What? They're piercing
through our shields at this range?

206
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,800
-They got Olov!
-We're in trouble!

207
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,380
Askeladd!

208
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,880
Crossbows, huh?

209
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,300
Those will cause some fair damage.

210
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,300
Now's our chance.

211
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,060
Maximum hits before they land!

212
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
A child?

213
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,030
What?

214
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,610
The assault stopped?

215
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,330
Maybe they ran out of arrows.

216
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,040
Prepare to land, you bastards!

217
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,710
This is our chance!

218
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, no!

219
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,750
-Kill the bastard!
-Damn kid!

220
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,050
Don't let him get away!

221
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,220
Go!

222
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,600
Storm the fortress!

223
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,480
All right, tear this place apart!

224
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,620
Are they sure
they can hold the front gate?

225
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,500
Men, take care of these guys quickly.

226
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,250
Heave-ho!

227
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,820
These Normans are incredible.

228
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,710
My strategy easily
wore this fortress down.

229
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,050
The fortress captain was killed in battle.

230
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,640
According to the enemy soldiers,
it was the work of a child.

231
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,600
That brat?

232
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,350
These Normans are serious.

233
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,850
If we let them go now,
they'll become our enemy.

234
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,600
What shall we do?

235
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,280
They came over the ridge,
so they'll carry their ships back again.

236
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,700
That's when we'll strike.

237
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,240
They're like sitting ducks
with their ships on land.

238
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,000
Your Excellency!

239
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Report for  Jabbathe!

240
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,170
What is it? Speak.

241
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,300
The treasury…

242
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,220
Huh?

243
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:33,180
Where is my treasure?

244
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,810
The houses and church
have been raided too.

245
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,770
They took everything of value.

246
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,780
I see…

247
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,700
I wish to congratulate
the leader of the Franks!

248
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,750
We've divided the spoils in two.

249
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,750
Your half is the victory.

250
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,710
Our half is the treasure.

251
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,880
No complaints, right?

252
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,340
I think this is fairly modest

253
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,010
since we're letting you keep the fortress!

254
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,470
You bastard!

255
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,390
-They're going down the waterfall.
-Barbarians!

256
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,310
Ready the ships!

257
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,350
But all the ships in the fortress
have been destroyed.

258
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,480
Crooks!

259
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,150
Sorry, but I don't understand Frankish.

260
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,280
Now then, shall we set sail?

261
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,070
Thorfinn isn't here yet.

262
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,830
Oh, you're right.

263
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,660
Well then, he must be dead.

264
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,250
I guess we'll take his share, too.

265
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,760
He's alive!

266
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,220
What a tenacious kid. Are you injured?

267
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,140
Askeladd!

268
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,100
The general's head.

269
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,390
So… you got it.

270
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,150
You promised.

271
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,400
You cannot refuse me.

272
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,450
I, Thorfinn, warrior of Iceland,
son of Thors,

273
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,490
by the sword of my father,
challenge you, Askeladd, to a duel

274
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,670
to avenge my father.

275
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,790
What? He's doing it now?

276
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,420
He's tough.

277
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,380
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf,

278
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,220
in the name of my ancestor Artorius,

279
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,390
accept your challenge.

280
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,850
However…

281
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,390
let's do this later!

282
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,020
We've got to escape now!

283
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
Row, you bastards!

284
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,860
Hey!

285
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,860
Don't linger,
or else they'll seize us on the river!

286
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,490
Bastard! Stop taunting me!

287
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,160
Who cares about a dragon?

288
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,410
-I'm not scared!
-That's right!

289
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,660
But you know…

290
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,420
There it is!

291
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,940
This is farewell!

292
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,770
Farewell, Franks!

293
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,990
We're rich!

294
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,900
We can get through the winter!

295
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,330
All right!

296
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
