1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,930
I see.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,270
So Canute has died?

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,070
No, to be precise, he is missing.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,490
Ragnar's troop
intended to rescue Prince Canute

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,530
and crossed swords
with Thorkell's army at Marlborough.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,320
Amidst the chaos

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,410
the prince disappeared.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,540
Then are they still surrounded
by Thorkell's army?

9
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,460
Yes.

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,800
However,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,340
two days later,

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,470
His Highness was not found
among the enemy army.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,980
It may be that he has survived
and is awaiting rescue.

14
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,900
But even if we send help,

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,980
we would have to wait until spring.

16
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,940
I cannot fathom the worry
you must be feeling, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,080
If only

18
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,960
Canute had exceeded
his older brother Harald's abilities,

19
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,050
then perhaps he wouldn't have disappeared.

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,310
Oh, it's snowing.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,020
The war will end soon.

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
Winter,

23
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,110
do you intend to freeze
even the hearts of warriors?

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,870
Oh, winter!

25
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,410
Commander!

26
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,580
Do you want to eat
roasted or stewed pork?

27
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,870
Both!

28
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Swallow first. I can't understand you.

29
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
No matter what anyone says,

30
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,890
it was painful
watching the prince get away.

31
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,810
No, you handed him over.

32
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,230
That prince was a coward,
but he could have been useful.

33
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,440
He could've been elevated
to bring about a new dynasty.

34
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,360
He'd be effective
for consolidating the soldiers.

35
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,450
And if you were to help elevate him,
you'd gain some influence.

36
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,410
Right?

37
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,250
Hey! You English maiden!

38
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,670
Yes?

39
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,090
Bring me a cask of beer!

40
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,920
Excuse me!

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,300
One more cask of beer!

42
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,220
Not again, damn it!

43
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,340
Are these fiends trying
to eat the whole village?

44
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,760
At this rate,
they might as well have raided us!

45
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,720
Stop your whining!

46
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,320
If he was to be captured either way,
I should have handed him to the English.

47
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,860
Huh? What's so funny?

48
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,110
You're troubled, aren't you?

49
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,450
When the fires of war burn low,
you look for another spark.

50
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,620
Of course I do, bastard.

51
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,210
We're warriors, are we not?

52
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,500
We're only warriors
if we're on a battlefield.

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,720
But you know, I've heard a bad rumor.

54
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,550
At the next
Witenagemot assembly in Wessex,

55
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,850
the title of Bretwalda
will be bestowed on King Sweyn.

56
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,560
That would be a total surrender!

57
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,600
Right.

58
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,320
Denmark will swallow England whole.

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,360
The nobility wish to end the war
even if it means relinquishing the throne.

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,950
Why must all my worst fears come true?

61
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,410
What will you do?

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,160
Will you die honorably
fighting King Sweyn's army?

63
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,540
Fool!

64
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,130
I love a good battle, but I hate losing!

65
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,670
When I fight, I expect to win!

66
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,720
How dull.

67
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,430
If only the world
would just keep fighting forever.

68
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,520
I have a message! Is the feudal lord here?

69
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,570
Is something wrong, Ear?

70
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,610
Yeah, it's too damn cold.

71
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,410
The snow is absorbing the sound,

72
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,910
so even my range of hearing is limited.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,920
It's better than sending out scouts.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,170
This way no one will know we're here.

75
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,340
Then do something about them.

76
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,300
Nobody would mistake them for farmers.

77
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,680
The monk and the prince?
Keep your ear on them.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,890
He's saying,

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
"Forgive us."

80
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,690
Are they going to beg for forgiveness
every time something happens?

81
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,860
What a nuisance.

82
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,110
Oh Lord above…

83
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,150
our Father who art in Heaven,

84
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,910
please summon the souls of these villagers

85
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,080
to be by to your side.

86
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,830
Please save the souls
of those who killed these people.

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,460
Please, forgive us our sins.

88
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,340
Is this really the time
to be praying for strangers? Fools.

89
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,060
Lord…

90
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,060
are my words reaching your ears?

91
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,610
Our Lord,

92
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,240
you

93
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,070
created us in thine divine image.

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,200
But your power was not shared with us.

95
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,080
Lord…

96
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,210
if the good and the evil
are loved with equal measure,

97
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,130
for what purpose
are the helpless being tested so?

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,550
Lord…

99
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,760
is my voice

100
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,970
being heard by your ears?

101
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,770
Our Lord,

102
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,770
I am doubting

103
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
your love.

104
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Stop!

105
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,280
You doubt

106
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,410
the Lord?

107
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,500
You still call yourself
a believer of Christ?

108
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,750
Fear and tremble!

109
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,090
We cannot doubt the Lord's love!

110
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,050
There is…

111
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,020
There is no father who does not love

112
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,730
his own child.

113
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,980
Your Highness…

114
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,490
Please wait!

115
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,040
Father.

116
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,790
A troop of Danes?

117
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,300
Are you serious?

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,920
Yes, that's what the messenger said.

119
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,760
They're occupying a village
further up the River Severn.

120
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,890
A local lord has requested help.

121
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,020
According to a survivor's story,

122
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,900
there were 100 to 200 enemy soldiers.

123
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,900
Soldiers from surrounding areas
are already on their way.

124
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,400
If you, the great warrior Thorkell,
would be willing to help, then please…

125
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,200
What do you think?

126
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,910
Regardless of what I think,

127
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,040
there aren't many Danish troops
who'd act on their own

128
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,330
in this season in that position.

129
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,830
They feigned for the sea,
but headed for Gainsborough by land.

130
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,170
So they're trapped
in the snow and are resting?

131
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,630
That is the most likely scenario.

132
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
It's Thorfinn and Canute.

133
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,850
All right!

134
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,180
Wake everyone up! Prepare to march!

135
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,100
Yes, sir.

136
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,600
You two.

137
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,610
-Yeah, you.
-Yes?

138
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,360
Prepare food for our journey.

139
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,610
I want 500 servings for five days.

140
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,240
What? 500 servings?

141
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,410
So it begins.

142
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,200
Things are getting interesting.

143
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,750
If this battle goes my way,

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,130
I may still have some fun.

145
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,510
How many, Ear?

146
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,640
Not sure.

147
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,310
It could be 50 or 100.

148
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,690
They're extending their line
along the woods in the east.

149
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
They sniffed us out quickly.

150
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,610
Did we miss someone?

151
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,190
Who knows?

152
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,110
But this revelation can't be helped.

153
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,620
We're leaving?

154
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,990
It's impossible to leave tonight.

155
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,410
I've only finished two sleds.

156
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,540
I started the third only yesterday.

157
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,790
Really? Well done.

158
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,670
Finish it by nightfall.

159
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,880
Drop whatever can't be finished by then.

160
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

161
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,050
There are only two carpenters.

162
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,220
The English army has found us.

163
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,850
What? They found us?

164
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,270
Yes. They're pushing
their way through the snow now.

165
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,060
They seem to have
an intense aversion to Danes.

166
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,270
It can't be.

167
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,650
This is our only chance to escape.

168
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,820
If you understand, get moving.

169
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,610
Yes. All right.

170
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,780
Bjorn, get the men
prepared for a counter-attack.

171
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,870
We'll seize their commanding officer.

172
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,990
I want to know how they discovered us.

173
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,910
Understood.

174
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,120
Wait a moment, Bjorn.

175
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,620
One more thing.

176
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,130
This is an opportunity.

177
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,500
to do that other thing.

178
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,760
We've been found?

179
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,880
This is bad.

180
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,640
It'll be fine.

181
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,890
The English are weak.

182
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,390
No, that's not what I mean.

183
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,640
I'm talking about Askeladd's luck.

184
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,230
His luck?

185
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,650
First, the heavy snowfall and now this.

186
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,900
This is the first time
his plans haven't gone smoothly.

187
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,950
That's a delicious-looking rabbit.

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,250
Did you catch it, Thorfinn?

189
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,580
What?

190
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,840
Are you going to eat that alone?
Will you roast it?

191
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,090
What's your point?

192
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,210
Eating only meat isn't good for you.

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,880
Simmer it with some vegetables.

194
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,600
Make that rabbit into a stew.

195
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,350
Shut up.

196
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,980
I'll eat my food however I want.

197
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,440
You'll need a stove either way.

198
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,400
Come on in.

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,610
Your Highness!
We have fava beans, cabbage, and rabbit.

200
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,570
Rabbit?

201
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,530
Yes.

202
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,320
Thorfinn caught it.

203
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,580
Will you contribute it to the soup?

204
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,750
Good job.

205
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,380
Drain the blood and clean the innards.

206
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,520
Not bad for some crude ingredients.

207
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,850
It's the rabbit.

208
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,980
I was tired of eating salted meat.

209
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,400
Thank you.

210
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,530
What's wrong? No need to hold back.

211
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,860
It's your rabbit.

212
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,870
It's good, isn't it?

213
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,910
Next time, bring us a deer!

214
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,170
I thought royalty
didn't cook their own food.

215
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,170
It's a hobby.

216
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,380
I normally don't cook,

217
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,300
and only Ragnar knows about it.

218
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,800
Please don't tell anyone.

219
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,010
It's not a bad thing.

220
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,020
A long time ago,

221
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,480
I once cooked a cod.

222
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,570
I thought it turned out well,
so I brought it to my father.

223
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:19,160
But before tasting it,
he flew into a rage.

224
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,670
He said, "The son of a king
does not cook like a lowly slave."

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,170
After that, I was forbidden to cook.

226
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,090
There is no need
for a prince to have this skill.

227
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,560
That was a time when
His Majesty was busy with many things.

228
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,560
When the war is over,
we'll cook some fowl and bring it to him.

229
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,650
Surely, the king will be overjoyed.

230
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,070
What kind of fowl?

231
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,070
I've never cooked fowl before.

232
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,620
It could be chicken or duck.

233
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,410
Remember the duck you ate for Yule?

234
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,460
Yes, that was delicious.

235
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,380
I asked the cook for his secret recipe.

236
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,250
He said he made good use of the broth.

237
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,460
The broth? I see.

238
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,510
Ragnar!

239
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,470
You idiot! I've got a message!

240
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,350
What is it? What happened?

241
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,680
We've been found by the enemy.

242
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,270
They're already fighting
in the eastern forest.

243
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,520
What?

244
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,400
Their numbers seem low,
but we must still take precautions.

245
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,780
What do you mean?

246
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,080
We've only been hiding here for ten days!

247
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,450
How were we found?

248
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,160
How should I know!

249
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,460
What a disaster.

250
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,170
They killed all those villagers.

251
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,800
In any case,

252
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,680
if we can hold off the English,
be prepared to move.

253
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,510
This is why I've been saying
we should return to Wales!

254
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,680
No, we'll be going to Derby.

255
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,310
We're venturing further
into enemy territory?

256
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,270
Bring Askeladd here!

257
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,650
Right now!

258
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,570
He's commanding the front line.

259
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,570
If you want to talk,
you're free to go yourself.

260
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,200
I'll take you.

261
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,080
Damn it!

262
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,830
Subordinates are only
as good as their leader!

263
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,580
You even speak informally!

264
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,460
He can't even command his own luck!
He calls himself a Norse warrior?

265
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,340
Today, by my sword,
he'll know the cost of his foolishness.

266
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,510
Hey!

267
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,470
Hey!

268
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,350
The battle cries are over there.

269
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,650
You finally noticed?

270
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,940
You sure are slow.

271
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,360
What? What are you bastards suggesting?

272
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,010
Black guard.

273
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,720
Sorry, conehead.

274
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,810
It's Askeladd's orders.

275
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,110
You want to fight?

276
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,200
It doesn't matter to us.

277
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,110
You're dead either way.

278
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,620
Call Askeladd here.

279
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,000
There's something he must know.

280
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,840
If it's your last testament,
you can tell me. I'll hear it.

281
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,090
Just call him!

282
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,050
It's regarding the prince!

283
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,220
I must tell him directly.

284
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,060
Quickly!

285
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,560
I will hear your last testament.

286
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:22,030
Shall I dismiss the others?

287
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,570
The voices stopped.

288
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,830
The battle is over.

289
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,830
Goodness.

290
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,170
The stew has gone cold.

291
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,590
I am grateful to you.

292
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,220
You've done well protecting
that coward of a prince for so long.

293
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,230
And your death
will surely further his prosperity.

294
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:58,610
I will inherit your duties as of today.

295
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,610
After your death in battle,

296
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,400
I will take over.

297
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,660
Vow to your gods.

298
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,870
Vow that after I'm gone,
no matter what happens…

299
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,880
you will protect Prince Canute.

300
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,010
No matter what happens,
I will protect Prince Canute

301
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,640
so that the death
of the warrior Ragnar was not in vain.

302
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,890
Satisfied?

303
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,730
How tormenting

304
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,650
that I must entrust the prince
to someone like you.

305
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,650
You should hurry.

306
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,490
You're losing quite a lot of blood.

307
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,660
Before Gainsborough…

308
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,080
you should prepare…

309
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,210
you should prepare yourself.

310
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,590
Right now, the courtiers of Jelling

311
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,090
are fighting over the Danish throne

312
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,720
and have split into two factions.

313
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,600
Prince Canute is being made
the leader of one faction,

314
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,770
and the other faction
is being led by his elder brother Harald.

315
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,950
Both princes have no say in the matter.

316
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,370
It is a power struggle
among self-interested traitors.

317
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,420
And His Majesty fears
the Kingdom of Denmark will be divided.

318
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,920
He may have already
made the decision in his heart…

319
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,260
to kill

320
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,680
one of the princes.

321
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,520
King Sweyn would kill a prince?

322
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,860
The reason the king
has now sent the prince to war

323
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,150
was to have him killed in battle.

324
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,860
Be careful.

325
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,360
At this time

326
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,620
Prince Canute's

327
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,620
true enemy

328
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,750
is none other than his father, King Sweyn.

329
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,580
Go into exile.

330
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,130
That's all you can do now.

331
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,260
In Gainsborough,

332
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,260
my younger brother

333
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,550
will make the necessary

334
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,560
arrangements.

335
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:48,780
What a mess.

336
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,740
You should've told me that earlier!

337
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,370
Please.

338
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,580
For the last time.

339
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
Just one last look.

340
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,750
Let me see the prince…

341
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,670
to say goodbye.

342
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,800
No.

343
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,510
Your Highness.

344
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,140
When the war is over…

345
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,860
we'll cook some fowl.

346
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Surely,

347
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,280
the king

348
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,030
will be…

349
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,620
overjoyed.

350
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
