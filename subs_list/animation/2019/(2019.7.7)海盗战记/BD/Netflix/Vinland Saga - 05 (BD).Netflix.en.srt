00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,690
-Are we out of booze?
-That's how I dull the pain!

2
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,110
Damn.

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,580
When will we get there?
Wherever we're picking up our gold.

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,910
Be patient. We're almost there.

5
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,540
EPISODE 5: THE TROLL'S CHILD

6
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,190
Damn it.

7
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,830
ENGLAND, NEAR THE RIVER HUMBER

8
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,040
Who will watch the ship?

9
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,630
We're only making a short stop.
We won't stay long.

10
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,730
Get up!

11
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,320
Don't run. If you move, I'll hurt you.

12
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,410
Let no one escape.
It'll be a problem if someone rats us out.

13
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,870
Two on the right.

14
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:32,340
That bastard ate it glady
without knowing what it was.

15
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,510
My head is pounding.

16
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,340
You drank too much.

17
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,600
What's wrong? You couldn't sleep?

18
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,980
Yeah. There was a gnat
buzzing around me last night.

19
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,100
A gnat?

20
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,610
What's this? A survivor?

21
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,740
No, it's him. He's the Troll of Jom's son.

22
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,950
Oh, was he left alive?

23
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,530
He's working hard so early in the morning.

24
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,990
I will avenge my father!

25
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,250
I challenge you to a duel!

26
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,040
Looking good, lad.

27
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
Oh, my! I'm so scared!

28
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,710
What will you do, Askeladd?

29
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,970
What a pain.

30
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,180
Gods.

31
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,470
You should've beheaded me
while I was sleeping.

32
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,930
I am the son of Thors.

33
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,520
I could never do something…

34
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,230
so cowardly!

35
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,030
There you go!

36
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,990
-He showed you, Askeladd!
-Kill him, laddie!

37
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,200
You wanna be a grown-up warrior?

38
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,170
Very well. Come at me.

39
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,940
-That's right!
-Just like that!

40
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,110
Damn it!

41
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,070
You can't let a big sword
like that swing you around.

42
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,700
-No mercy!
-He must be dead now, right?

43
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,010
We've confirmed the kill.

44
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,970
Here's your gold.

45
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
My gratitude for bring it.

46
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,440
Say hello to Floki for me.

47
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,280
No one said
we had to get along with the villagers.

48
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,410
That reminds me.
We have a message for you.

49
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,290
A message?

50
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,290
What was Thors's final moment like?

51
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,720
Nothing special.

52
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,140
His death was just like any other.

53
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,820
You're still alive?

54
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,780
You look awful.

55
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,280
Want some?

56
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,330
You'll get worse if you don't eat.

57
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,210
What's with him?
I was only showing him goodwill.

58
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,050
Damn it.

59
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,010
Damn it!

60
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Damn it!

61
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,030
He was glorious in his final moments.

62
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,410
Thors sacrificed himself for us.

63
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,950
I'm sorry, Helga. Ylva.

64
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,080
There are truly no words
to express just how sorry I am.

65
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,090
There's nothing you can do about death.

66
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,760
Sobbing will only make you hungry.

67
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,020
Well then, I'd better get to work.

68
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,310
Helga.

69
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:05,740
I swear that I will find Thorfinn.

70
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
No matter how many years it takes.

71
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,750
Well, I never thought
he would live long anyway.

72
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,380
Father was so eccentric.
He was bound to bring sorrow.

73
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,460
Your younger brother
is missing too, right?

74
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,260
Are you okay, Ylva?

75
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,890
Well, it'll be busy without men around.

76
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,390
Ylva.

77
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,560
-Here we go!
-You're overdoing it, Ylva!

78
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,940
Mother, how are you feeling?

79
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm feeling much better.

80
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,070
-I'm sorry you have to do everything--
-Rest.

81
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,490
It's okay. Just stay in bed.

82
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,620
Oh, no. The sheep!

83
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,590
Yes, yes. I'm sorry I'm late.

84
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,220
Once spring comes,
I'll have to shear the sheep too.

85
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,730
Here I go!

86
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,900
I harpooned it first!

87
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,570
What a busy day.

88
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,950
We really need more help around here.

89
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,370
Maybe I'll take a husband.

90
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,750
Thanks for all your hard work.

91
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,840
Let's go to sleep.

92
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,300
You go ahead.

93
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,760
I want to finish this first.

94
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,390
But it's too dark to see your hands.

95
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,520
You'll mar your weaving.

96
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,100
Ylva.

97
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,230
You've done enough.

98
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,110
Let's rest.

99
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,660
But it's just a little more.

100
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,030
It's okay.

101
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm not tired yet.

102
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,360
I'll kill him.

103
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,990
I swear I'll kill him.

104
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,920
Hey.

105
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,420
You're working hard.

106
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,340
You!

107
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,960
So?

108
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,470
You learn how to use your sword?

109
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,100
It's all because you used me as a shield!

110
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,440
Father is…

111
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,190
You coward!

112
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,150
You father was certainly strong.

113
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,820
But he was naive.

114
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,700
That's all.

115
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,410
Do not mock my father!

116
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,510
Well, you're too weak.

117
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,770
Hey.

118
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,940
I came across that kid in the forest.

119
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,690
What? He's still alive?

120
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,700
He's got the Troll of Jom's blood in him.

121
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,660
He won't just drop dead.

122
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,420
Like father, like son.

123
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,530
You can't let a big sword
like that swing you around.

124
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,340
Damn it!

125
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,940
We stayed quite a while.

126
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,450
I'm feeling like myself again.

127
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,570
That village was most comfortable.

128
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,700
-Someone is approaching.
-Huh?

129
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,540
I am Thorfinn, son of Thors.

130
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,590
In the name of almighty Odin,

131
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,550
I challenge you to a duel!

132
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,850
Good grief, he's relentless.

133
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,680
But he's got guts, doesn't he?

134
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,730
Take him on, Askeladd!

135
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,650
It's settled.

136
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,190
A leader shouldn't disappoint
the expectations of his men.

137
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,620
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf,

138
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,660
accept your challenge in the name of Odin.

139
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,830
I have no choice.

140
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,340
Good grief. Do you wish
to see your father that badly?

141
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,300
-It's all over!
-He can't win.

142
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,310
What? Finished already?

143
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,310
How boring.

144
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,440
Stand up!

145
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,810
This is a duel, isn't it?

146
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,320
Just let him go. He'll die at this rate.

147
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,450
What?

148
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,700
Weren't you the one
prodding me to take him on?

149
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,100
I've had enough.
I can't keep playing with you.

150
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,390
Besides, I don't enjoy killing kids.

151
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,610
Why?

152
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,190
What's with you?

153
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,400
I don't have time for this.

154
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,030
Wait!

155
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,410
I haven't lost yet!

156
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,820
Fight me, you coward!

157
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:57,160
You sure are a persistent brat.

158
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,580
I'm not finished yet!

159
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,960
Not until I've killed you!

160
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,580
I swear I'll kill you!

161
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,760
Prove yourself on the battlefield.

162
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,140
You're a Nordic warrior, aren't you?

163
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,510
Once you do that.

164
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,770
I'll reward you with a duel.

165
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,280
Is that a promise?

166
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,030
That's right. A warrior's promise.

167
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,540
I'll prove myself soon.

168
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,540
Soon…

169
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,540
I'll…

170
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,960
kill you.

171
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,930
