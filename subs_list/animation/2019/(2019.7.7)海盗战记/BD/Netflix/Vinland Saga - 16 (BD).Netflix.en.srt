1
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,500
He fought valiantly against
several English soldiers, but tragically

2
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,840
he was stabbed in the back with a spear.

3
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,050
I offer you my deepest condolences,
Your Highness.

4
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,560
He was eating stewed rabbit.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,690
He left in the middle of eating and…

6
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,070
How

7
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,150
strange this is.

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,110
He was just…

9
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,320
I mean…

10
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,330
We will leave immediately.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,710
Get ready.

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,330
Thorfinn, do not leave the prince's side.

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,250
What?

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,920
You're not serious?

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,050
I won't do it!

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,130
Hold up, you bastard!

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,510
It's your job to protect the prince.

18
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,930
How?

19
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,320
He was too weak to stand.

20
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,490
Will the feeble prince pull through?

21
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,280
This might've been a mistake, Askeladd.

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,160
Perhaps killing Ragnar was a bad idea?

23
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,120
Don't speak so loudly.

24
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,370
Most of the other men
don't know the situation.

25
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,870
It was the work of the English.

26
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,630
Stick to the story.

27
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,250
I don't know.

28
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,630
You and Ragnar
didn't exactly see eye to eye.

29
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,510
The prince is pathetic,
but he might catch on.

30
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,840
Nothing to worry about without proof.

31
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,970
The prince is pathetic
because Ragnar babied him.

32
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,640
Left alive he would have been a headache.

33
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,100
It's better that he's pathetic.

34
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,770
Easier to manipulate.

35
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:44,530
He's the perfect stepping stone
for attaining power.

36
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,660
Bjorn.

37
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,620
Why have you stayed with me all this time?

38
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
What?

39
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,250
Well, because…

40
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
that's what I want to do.

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,630
Same for me.

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,670
I, too, choose my leader.

43
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,840
And my leader should be
a man I choose to follow.

44
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,220
I'm joking.

45
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,100
It's a gamble, Bjorn.

46
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,560
If all goes well,
that prince may be reborn.

47
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,570
And if it falls through?

48
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,320
He's so pathetic,
he may never get back on his feet.

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,620
Then we'll abandon him…

50
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,490
if he's an unworthy leader.

51
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,960
So? Is he talking yet?

52
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,470
He's pissing me off.

53
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,470
He hasn't even screamed.

54
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,810
He's acting like a full-fledged martyr.
This is why I hate Christians.

55
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,060
There's no power in your kick.

56
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,730
Let me show you how.

57
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,610
You gotta kick someone like…

58
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,400
this!

59
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,280
Well done.

60
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,820
That was weak too.

61
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,030
Kick him in the jaw.

62
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,120
Wait a minute. I'm next.

63
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,120
That's enough!

64
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,830
My God, will you guys take it easy?

65
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,960
We can't very well question a dead man.

66
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,130
Just…

67
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,000
just kill me.

68
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,840
The Lord sees all.

69
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,840
All the sins you Danes have committed.

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,760
He still has his spirit.

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,140
Do we have shears?

72
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,600
Go look for some.

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,270
-Huh?
-What?

74
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,310
Shears, right?

75
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,650
Now then,

76
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,650
let me ask you again, English captain.

77
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,070
I want to know three things:

78
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,330
the size of your reinforcements,

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,410
how long it will take them to arrive,

80
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,460
and how you knew we were here.

81
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,340
Speak and your life will be spared.

82
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,300
You

83
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,960
you beasts…

84
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,930
will get what you deserve.

85
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,470
A suitable end

86
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,430
is waiting for you.

87
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,270
Here.

88
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,850
Will these work?

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,730
Yes.

90
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,070
Captain…

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,530
your nails

92
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,820
they're so long.

93
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,450
They really need a cleaning.

94
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,200
Why not trim them a bit?

95
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,130
Dear me, I cut it too close.

96
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Hold him down.

97
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,840
I want to know three things.

98
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,180
Like I said before.

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,640
Oh my, I did it again!

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,430
Twice in a row.

101
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,100
That's nasty.

102
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,400
Why's he still resisting?

103
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,650
Go to hell, you Danish bastards!

104
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,400
If only!

105
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,030
If only you hadn't come!

106
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,580
You burned my village!

107
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,160
You tortured and murdered
my wife and daughter!

108
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,210
You beasts!

109
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,000
This is our land! Get out!

110
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,210
Is that so?

111
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,420
We're beasts, are we?

112
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,680
Let me teach
you ignorant fools some history.

113
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,810
Listen carefully, Saxon.

114
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,900
Or are the people living here Angles?

115
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,770
Well, same thing.

116
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,150
To begin with,

117
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,320
this land never belonged to you.

118
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,660
The first inhabitants were the Celts.

119
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,780
They lived in the forest
and worshiped its spirits.

120
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,330
They are the ancestors of the Welsh.

121
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,620
After them,

122
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,420
the Romans came.

123
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,920
They controlled the land,

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,970
but they lived with the Celts and imparted
knowledge, technology, and culture.

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,220
After the Romans left,

126
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,260
you Angles-Saxons took over the land.

127
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,270
That was about 500 years ago.

128
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:30,850
However, with your arrival
you brought nothing to the Celts.

129
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,530
On the contrary, you pushed
the Celts into the hinterlands

130
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,150
and took these rich plains for yourself.

131
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,400
Lies!

132
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,280
I speak the truth.

133
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,870
If the Danes are beasts,

134
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,660
then you Anglo-Saxons are just as beastly.

135
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,040
You stole this land with violence,

136
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,880
so we Danes will use
even more violence to steal it back.

137
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,470
This is only fair.

138
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,550
Shut up!

139
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,930
No one will believe
the words of you barbarians!

140
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,480
A teacher hates the insolence
of students who don't listen.

141
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,400
What's this?

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Captain?

143
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,360
Now, that I've taken
a good look at your face,

144
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,160
your nose seems a bit long too.

145
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,540
Askeladd!

146
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,790
How many, Ear?

147
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,340
Not sure, but there are many.
They're coming from the south.

148
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,880
-Enemy reinforcements?
-But it's the middle of the night!

149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,310
The English attacking at night
is a real problem.

150
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,850
They're here!

151
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,400
You're too late! You're all going to die!

152
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,730
I hope you Danes murder each other!

153
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,940
Danes?

154
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,860
I'll tell you. It's Thorkell who's coming.

155
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,700
He's a formidable match for you!

156
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,370
It's Thorkell!

157
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,160
Thorkell? What are we going to do?

158
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,000
What?

159
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,540
Did he say Thorkell?

160
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,340
I'm not sure, but I think so.

161
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,630
If it's true, we're in trouble.

162
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,760
Thorkell?

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,340
He said Thorkell.

164
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,800
-It can't be.
-Is he serious?

165
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,310
Thorkell is coming!

166
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,650
Is that the village?

167
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,980
It seems to be.

168
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,820
All right, surround them!

169
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,070
Vali and Ingolf's men take the left.

170
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,660
Oddr, take the right.

171
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,160
I'll take the center.

172
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,040
The plan is to kill everyone!

173
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,580
But not the prince.

174
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,750
Also, there should be
a knife-wielding runt.

175
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,460
Don't kill him either.

176
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,420
He's for me to play with.

177
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,430
Thorkell is coming!

178
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,100
Let go of me, you common servant!

179
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,890
How dare you defy my orders!

180
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm not leaving Ragnar in this place!

181
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,980
I'm not going anywhere without Ragnar!

182
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,270
Relax, Your Highness.

183
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,860
We only have three sleds.
There's no room for his remains.

184
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,660
Then give him a funeral!
You must honor the dead!

185
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,780
That's an order!

186
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,660
There's no time for that either.

187
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,410
You!

188
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,800
No! I won't go anywhere with you!

189
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,970
Ragnar!

190
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,350
Ragnar is dead.

191
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,270
He won't come even if you call.

192
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,740
You…

193
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,450
Askeladd!

194
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,200
We've got deserters
trying to join Thorkell.

195
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,620
They were hiding in the hay.

196
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,510
It's just as Ragnar said.

197
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,840
Your luck has run out.

198
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,100
It's not just us.

199
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,480
Everyone thinks we're in trouble.

200
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,900
This time we won't make it.
Because this time

201
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,980
Thorkell has us surrounded!

202
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:52,820
Go if you want.

203
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,240
Listen up, you bastards!

204
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,370
Follow the leader you want.

205
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,000
You're free to go if you wish.

206
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,040
I won't blame you.

207
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,590
If you're with me,

208
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,130
then march!

209
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,640
We'll march
until we can shake off Thorkell!

210
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,810
March while you eat.

211
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,390
March while you sleep!

212
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,770
You hear me, bastards?

213
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,140
Expect to die if you don't keep up.

214
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,470
No!

215
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,470
Wait, Thorkell!

216
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,470
We're not with Askeladd!

217
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
We've come to serve you!

218
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,700
Your leader's name is Askeladd?

219
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,870
Oh, this is a nice sword.

220
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,490
This one's mine!

221
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,200
Wow. That's a lucky find.

222
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,870
If some of his men deserted,

223
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,290
then they must
have questioned his leadership.

224
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,880
Poor wretches.

225
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,550
You could have taken them with us.

226
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,430
Not a chance. They're trash.

227
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,640
I have no use for cowards
who'd desert rather than fight.

228
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,890
To the east!

229
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,650
All right, we're going after the prince!

230
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,190
Fire it up!

231
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,410
Right! You're leaning too far!

232
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,700
Go back.

233
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,160
No!

234
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,660
Go to my right!

235
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,170
Steady you go.

236
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,420
Slowly!

237
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,630
All right.

238
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,380
Hurry up! Don't hold up the line!

239
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,300
Torgrim and Atli.

240
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,720
With me.

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,760
Aye.

242
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,480
Take the lead destroying this bridge.

243
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,980
Hurry.

244
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,940
Got it.

245
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,770
This bridge is coming down!

246
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,940
Help if you've got an ax!

247
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm exhausted.

248
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,400
Is Thorkell close, Ear?

249
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,450
It's noisy, so I can't be sure.

250
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,120
But we may have time
to destroy the bridge.

251
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,840
Stop that! Knock it off.

252
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,220
Monk! What are you doing in there?

253
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:01,390
-Is there more drink?
-If there were, I wouldn't give it to you.

254
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,390
You're insatiable!
Of course, there's no more for you.

255
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,770
Don't you get it?
We're in a dire situation, monk!

256
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,500
Shit, this water's freezing.

257
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,380
Isn't this river a little shallow?

258
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,170
They'll just walk across.

259
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Destroying the bridge won't help?

260
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,510
Still, we can't leave it standing.

261
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,430
It might piss them off at least.

262
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:51,560
Askeladd seems to have run out
of that ingenuity he's so proud of?

263
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,160
Bjorn! Thorfinn!

264
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,170
-What is it?
-Come close.

265
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,170
What?

266
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,880
Bjorn, move the prince
to that horse cart and take the reins.

267
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,390
Thorfinn, get in with the prince
and stand by.

268
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,680
What are you…

269
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,140
Hey.

270
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,020
Askeladd!

271
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,940
Are you serious?

272
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,570
I have a gift.

273
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,570
With one glance at a man's face,
I can tell who he is.

274
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,080
Brash or weak, clever or foolish.

275
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:52,040
I can even pick out
the traitors amongst the loyal.

276
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,000
What?

277
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,630
Kidnap the prince? Brother!

278
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,590
Idiot! Keep your voice down!

279
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,550
Listen to me Atli, this troop is finished.

280
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,850
Let's take the prince
and offer him to Thorkell.

281
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,850
Most of the men are already thinking it.

282
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,730
The others will join if we speak up.

283
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,270
You're going to betray him?

284
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,650
Askeladd?

285
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:24,070
It sounds so bad
when you say it like that, Atli.

286
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,330
He's a good leader and he's done us well.

287
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,620
So we're making him
take responsibility as our leader.

288
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't worry.

289
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,960
We'll get through this, Brother.
We have every other time.

290
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,630
Until now.

291
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
But consider what's happened lately.

292
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,470
He's made several mistakes.

293
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,090
His luck is running out.

294
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,350
He thought he lost Thorkell,
but he found us anyway.

295
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,100
Don't look at me that way.

296
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,770
I admit

297
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,610
he's definitely a good leader.

298
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,360
But why did he pick a fight with Thorkell?

299
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,530
Brother.

300
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,240
I think it's unfortunate.

301
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,870
But it can't be helped.

302
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,240
Askeladd took a gamble
and it didn't pay off.

303
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,870
That's all it is.

304
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,880
Well done.

305
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,720
This will slow their sleds
when coming across.

306
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,470
What if they cross without sleds?

307
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,640
Then they'll spend time gathering food.

308
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,310
Without food,
they can't pursue us for long.

309
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,690
All right! Start marching!

310
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,830
They're here!

311
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:00,960
There's a flash.

312
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,320
I've found

313
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,070
you!

314
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,660
Seriously?

315
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,750
Unbelievable.

316
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,290
-Three men with one spear? Unfathomable!
-No, four!

317
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,840
-This is bad.
-Damn, we're in trouble.

318
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,010
-We're in serious trouble!
-Hey!

319
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,220
Relax, you bastards.

320
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,800
We still have distance between us
and we felled the bridge.

321
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,510
Forget that spear.

322
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,930
The bridge?

323
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,520
Who cares about the bridge!

324
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,940
They can just walk across the river!

325
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,020
It's a short delay.

326
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,690
If that's what you think,
then we must march.

327
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,360
Time is precious.

328
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,740
Again?

329
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,830
March and march and march!

330
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,000
Do you know any other words?

331
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,170
We cannot win against Thorkell.

332
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,670
Have patience for another day.

333
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,420
Wrecking that bridge will have its effect.

334
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,800
They can't march without supplies.

335
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,060
They'll have trouble
bringing it with them.

336
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,140
If they leave it,
they'll be soldiers without food.

337
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,190
Without food,
they can only march for one day.

338
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,810
Understand, you bastards?

339
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,770
If you do, then march!

340
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,070
There's no guarantee
we will survive another day!

341
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,200
Is that so?

342
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,410
Then this is where we part.

343
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,080
Forgive me, but I'm in a hurry.

344
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
