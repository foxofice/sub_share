1
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:24,902
It feels so good.

2
00:00:38,707 --> 00:00:39,708
What's this?

3
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:41,210
Breast pads.

4
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:44,713
They're magical items that
make your boobs look bigger.

5
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:51,345
Come on. You got two more.

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,148
Okay. Last touch.

7
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,613
Okay. That's it. The fun's over.

8
00:01:09,697 --> 00:01:12,449
Good, isn't it?

9
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,578
Congratulations on
getting to touch nice boobs.

10
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:18,622
Now we're even.

11
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,416
Meowy is alive and kicking.

12
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:23,377
-I don't have to be a Devil Hunter anymore
-<i>There's a lot I want to say…</i>

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,629
-but Makima would never let me go.
-<i>It's weird.</i>

14
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:28,424
I'll be so good as to assist you.

15
00:01:28,507 --> 00:01:29,883
Hope we can be good teammates.

16
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:33,971
Meowy, time for bed.

17
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:41,812
<i>Is that it?</i>

18
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:11,819
CHAINSAW MAN

19
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,120
This is delicious.

20
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,582
I want another plate.

21
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,376
-Give me that if you don't want it.
-Hey you!

22
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,379
Where are we going to kill Devils today?

23
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,173
Hey.

24
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,384
Hey.

25
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,886
Hey!

26
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,388
Chop!

27
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,893
<i>This is an apology for damaging buildings.</i>

28
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:48,939
This is a confirmation of
the usage of the Devil's corpse.

29
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:49,898
And…

30
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:52,359
This is from the Ministry of Transport.

31
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,403
Sign here, and here.

32
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,370
Is all this paperwork annoying?

33
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,914
You defeated Bat Devil,

34
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,249
but it feels like a punishment.

35
00:04:10,002 --> 00:04:12,754
Denji, is there anything on your mind?

36
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:17,176
I…

37
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:21,513
I finally got what I've always wanted.

38
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:25,184
But it didn't feel that great

39
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:28,937
when I got it.

40
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:35,110
If I want something else in the future,
when I finally get what I want,

41
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:41,200
would I still feel like
I'm happier during the process?

42
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:46,955
Then it's just a load of crap, isn't it?

43
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:52,211
What are you referring to?

44
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:55,130
I touched a girl's boobs
for the first time.

45
00:04:55,214 --> 00:04:57,716
It wasn't as great as I thought.

46
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:08,852
Denji.

47
00:05:09,436 --> 00:05:10,854
I think, for something like that,

48
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,567
the more you know the other person,

49
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:16,944
the better it'll feel.

50
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:24,243
It's hard to tell what they're thinking.

51
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:29,373
So you have to look carefully
at their hands first.

52
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,461
The length of their fingers.

53
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,968
Are their palms cold

54
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,011
or warm?

55
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,181
The shape of their ears.

56
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:53,647
Did anyone bite your finger before?

57
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,898
B-Bite…

58
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:56,608
Remember this.

59
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:59,903
Even if you couldn't see,

60
00:06:01,113 --> 00:06:03,031
you have to be able to tell it's me

61
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:05,701
from how hard you get bitten.

62
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:08,787
Remember.

63
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,675
I will.

64
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:54,207
Denji.

65
00:06:56,126 --> 00:06:57,794
I have a request.

66
00:06:59,087 --> 00:07:00,088
Is that okay?

67
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:03,342
Yeah.

68
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:11,183
I want you to defeat the Gun Devil.

69
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:13,560
The Gun Devil…

70
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:18,357
It showed up in America 13 years ago.

71
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,525
Current whereabouts are unknown.

72
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,987
Every Devil Hunter dreams to kill it.

73
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,490
It's very strong.

74
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:32,204
But I think you can kill it.

75
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:37,709
Because you are more special
than other Devil Hunters.

76
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:42,130
If you can kill the Gun Devil,

77
00:07:42,798 --> 00:07:44,883
I'll grant you a wish.

78
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,385
Anything.

79
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:52,349
If I can kill the Gun Devil…

80
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,018
Ms. Makima will grant me a wish.

81
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:57,396
Anything.

82
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,859
So… You mean…

83
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:05,862
As long as I kill the Gun Devil,

84
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:09,658
you'll do anything I want?

85
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:17,582
Anything… Such as--

86
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,918
Anything, Denji.

87
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:23,672
Cool. Even dirty stuff?

88
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:29,177
This mission is hard enough
for me to believe that you'd deserve it.

89
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:33,765
It was when the whole world tried to
use guns to gain an advantage over Devils.

90
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:37,102
Guns started to get used
in civil conflicts.

91
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,356
<i>Such cases were all over the news,</i>

92
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,402
<i>which made the people
even more afraid of guns.</i>

93
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:50,741
<i>There was a massive terrorist attack
with guns involved in America.</i>

94
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:54,244
<i>That was when the Gun Devil appeared.</i>

95
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:01,960
"This is where I live."

96
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:04,045
The City Mouse said.

97
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:08,175
"That house is so big."

98
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,427
-"The City Mouse's family…"
-Dad.

99
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:12,512
Let's go play catch.

100
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:14,806
Taiyo doesn't feel well.

101
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,058
Go play by yourself.

102
00:09:18,018 --> 00:09:19,603
Taiyo is always like that.

103
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,438
He's sick all the time.

104
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:25,442
Big Brother should care
for his sibling. Go and play alone.

105
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:28,528
I…

106
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,823
I want to play with my big brother.

107
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:53,595
Don't follow me.

108
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:59,643
You're so annoying. Don't follow me.

109
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,398
I want to play alone.

110
00:10:12,364 --> 00:10:13,240
Take that!

111
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,078
Idiot. I told you to stop.

112
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,088
So cold.

113
00:10:34,678 --> 00:10:37,848
Mom and Dad will kill me
if you catch a cold.

114
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:43,478
Let's play catch
so our hands won't get cold.

115
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:46,147
Go home and get your gloves.

116
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:49,526
Yeah!

117
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:15,844
<i>Gun Devil killed 1.2 million people
in five minutes</i>

118
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:20,265
<i>and has been staying
under the radar till now.</i>

119
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:30,483
From then on,
their fear of Devils grew stronger.

120
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:35,447
The Devils got stronger than ever.

121
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:40,160
To keep the Gun Devil's strength
under control as best as we could,

122
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,662
the law forbids people to keep guns.

123
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:47,042
The government started to limit
the news reports of such cases too.

124
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,501
I see.

125
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,587
I'm not sure I fully understand,

126
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:53,798
but the gist is that
it's unbelievably strong, right?

127
00:11:54,507 --> 00:11:56,801
Do you think you can defeat it?

128
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,554
Well, I guess…

129
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:02,390
If I try my very best,

130
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:05,226
there should be no problem.

131
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,937
Then our first step

132
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:10,273
is to find the Gun Devil.

133
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:14,486
How do we do that?

134
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,406
Here are the pieces of the Gun Devil
that we've managed to collect.

135
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,659
It moves at a very high speed

136
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:22,827
so a part of its body burned and fell off.

137
00:12:23,536 --> 00:12:25,955
When a Devil eats this,

138
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,001
it'll get stronger
because of the Gun Devil's power.

139
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:31,961
See? It stuck back together.

140
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:37,008
The Gun Devil is very strong,

141
00:12:37,092 --> 00:12:39,844
so that's why when a piece of his body
reaches a certain size,

142
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,514
it goes back to the original body.

143
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:46,393
When this piece gets bigger…

144
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,688
<i>we'll find the Gun Devil.</i>

145
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:51,648
Found it.

146
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:57,529
This Devil ate a piece of the Gun Devil?

147
00:12:58,947 --> 00:13:01,783
It is indeed too much
for a low-level Devil.

148
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:04,369
Did it eat the piece?

149
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:05,787
Or was it forced to eat it?

150
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,542
Whichever happened,
it doesn't change our mission.

151
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,836
We kill every Devil there is.

152
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,799
Then we can find it.

153
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,888
<i>The Public Safety Sector got a mission.</i>

154
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:26,808
<i>Someone saw a Devil in a hotel.</i>

155
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,811
<i>The guests' status is unknown.</i>

156
00:13:30,645 --> 00:13:34,649
<i>Several civil Devil Hunters died
trying to kill this Devil.</i>

157
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,112
<i>It probably ate a piece of the Gun Devil.</i>

158
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:42,073
<i>Tokyo Special Division 4</i>

159
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,242
<i>sent six members for the job.</i>

160
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,915
The Devil is hiding
somewhere in the hotel.

161
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,461
It's not a regular Devil.

162
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:57,130
It's probably a Devil who ate
a piece of the Gun Devil.

163
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:00,341
It can probably be Gun Devil itself.

164
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:04,179
The bigger the piece,
the stronger the attraction.

165
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:05,972
It can't be the Gun Devil.

166
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:08,349
Right.

167
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:11,186
Sounds great.

168
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:12,103
I'll get it.

169
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,607
You forgot about honorifics.

170
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,691
-Huh?
-Huh?

171
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:21,321
-Why? What do we get out of it?
-Humans are so stupid and arrogant.

172
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:26,868
Mr. Hayakawa.

173
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:28,411
Sir.

174
00:14:28,495 --> 00:14:29,662
Good.

175
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:30,830
Yeah!

176
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:33,917
-That's easy.
-Mr. Hayakawa.

177
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:36,920
Should we really trust them
as our comrades

178
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,756
when battling the Devils?

179
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:43,468
A Fiend and a rascal.

180
00:14:44,302 --> 00:14:45,804
I can't trust them.

181
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:49,099
You don't have to.

182
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:53,186
They are the first to
face Devils in missions.

183
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,688
If they try to run away or betray us,

184
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:57,398
we can just kill them.

185
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,193
Darn, that's how you treat animals.

186
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,403
You have no human rights.

187
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:06,324
Why is he so grumpy?

188
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,826
Is it because of this morning?

189
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:10,203
Did that prank go too far?

190
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,413
That wasn't a prank anymore.

191
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,665
I ought to kill you two!

192
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,708
Wow, scary. What happened?

193
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:20,046
Aki, don't go so hard on these poor kids.

194
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:20,964
That's right.

195
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:23,925
I almost got killed by Bat
and I don't even get to rest.

196
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:25,093
I want a reward.

197
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,681
Right. I'll be so good
as to offer something.

198
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:33,226
Whoever kills the Devil this time,

199
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,062
I'll kiss them on the cheeks.

200
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,609
No. Please don't do that.

201
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,862
How could a maiden…

202
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,241
Motivation only comes with reward.

203
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,868
Right?

204
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:01,546
I don't need a kiss.

205
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:04,382
Don't worry. I have my motivation.

206
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:05,383
What's this?

207
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,887
I've decided who I'm gonna kiss.

208
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:12,849
I'll collect whatever pieces just for her.

209
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,352
I won't kiss anyone
before I kill the Gun Devil.

210
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:18,563
Oh, my.

211
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:20,899
I can't believe you said
that in front of Aki.

212
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:24,027
And someone gave me an important lesson.

213
00:16:24,611 --> 00:16:29,115
Those things only feel good
when you understand each other.

214
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:33,536
I don't even know your name, so of course,
I'm not interested in your kiss.

215
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,040
Really now?

216
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,836
Well Denji, if you kill the Devil,

217
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,924
I'll give you a French kiss.

218
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:54,432
Hey! Stop!

219
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,685
It's dangerous to act alone. Don't run!

220
00:16:57,769 --> 00:16:58,603
8TH FLOOR

221
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,940
-It's so fun to tease boys.
-Did you hear…

222
00:17:02,023 --> 00:17:04,442
What should I do…

223
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:05,944
I want to drink blood.

224
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:08,446
It's dangerous! I told you to stop!

225
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,451
For the last six months,

226
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,828
Ms. Himeno has been
helping me and taking care of me.

227
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:18,831
How can a nameless rascal take her lips?

228
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,042
I'd rather get a kiss on the cheek.

229
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:21,960
Piss off!

230
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,545
Get away from me, stinky guy! Gross!

231
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,673
-What did you say?
-Go to hell!

232
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:29,342
-I've something else that I want!
-I want to join!

233
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,261
Are you kidding? You're just a rookie…

234
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:32,679
-Ms. Himeno.
-Why would I care?

235
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,515
-Can we use these rookies?
-Come on!

236
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,186
Arai is not strong enough,
but he's motivated.

237
00:17:41,187 --> 00:17:44,440
-Kobeni is not brave, but she's strong.
-Go…

238
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:49,070
Aki, do you think they can survive?

239
00:17:49,821 --> 00:17:51,197
Let's kill each other!

240
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:55,076
It doesn't matter
whether I think they are strong or not.

241
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,496
After a year,
they'll all either die or quit.

242
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:02,333
-That's not what I asked.
-I'll kill you, Power!

243
00:18:04,002 --> 00:18:05,586
-Don't die, Aki.
-I'll kill you too, short guy!

244
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,671
Why?

245
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:23,855
Himeno.

246
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:26,941
He's your new teammate.

247
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:31,404
He's a little bratty,
but good enough to use.

248
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,572
Do work hard.

249
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:39,662
I'm Aki.

250
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,872
Nice to meet you.

251
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:48,629
Can we use you?

252
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:53,760
Probably. Who knows?

253
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,472
You're my sixth teammate.

254
00:18:58,139 --> 00:18:59,474
They all died.

255
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,935
They all died
because they were all useless.

256
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,232
Don't die, Aki.

257
00:19:09,859 --> 00:19:13,780
There's not a sight of the Devil.

258
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,618
Can we trust that piece you have?

259
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,581
I'm dozing off.

260
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,499
Aki.

261
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:27,418
It's coming.

262
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,069
Got you!

263
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:55,571
It's floating!

264
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,365
Let's fight!

265
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,375
Dirty Devil.

266
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,627
I scared you so much
that you were floating.

267
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,797
No, that's my ability.

268
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,714
What?

269
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,051
I made a contract with Ghost Devil.

270
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:19,929
I gave it my right eye to use its power.

271
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,181
I can control its right hand.

272
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:26,811
My Ghost is invisible and strong.
Isn't that convenient?

273
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:29,605
How is it, Aki?

274
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,023
Is there a piece of Gun?

275
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,359
No reaction.

276
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:34,735
It's not this one.

277
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,987
Yeah?

278
00:20:36,654 --> 00:20:38,030
Let's go upstairs then.

279
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:44,454
Is it okay for you to tell me
all about your ability like that?

280
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,707
I thought you were here
to keep me under control.

281
00:20:48,207 --> 00:20:50,501
It's easier to work together
if you know my ability.

282
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:54,172
And I've still got an ace
up my sleeve. It's fine…

283
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,007
Really?

284
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,469
What if I say I'll kill this girl?

285
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,680
Put your weapon away.

286
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:05,641
I can kill you anytime
if you try something funny.

287
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:10,146
I can't touch it…

288
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,113
Let's save all the trouble
and be nice to each other.

289
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,993
One day I'll eat you!

290
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,412
Don't you dare. She's gonna kill me.

291
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,582
You lot. The Devil is around here.

292
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:30,750
Be quiet…

293
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:35,922
Eh?

294
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:44,555
-What is it?
-It must taste terrible to eat it raw.

295
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:49,435
We just went up
from the 8th floor to the 9th.

296
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,436
-Yeah?
-Whatever, idiot.

297
00:21:52,313 --> 00:21:53,731
This is the 8th floor.

298
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,318
Maybe you saw it wrong?

299
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,072
No. Something's wrong. I'll go check.

300
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,658
Got it. I'll make it a steak.

301
00:22:03,741 --> 00:22:04,575
Steak?

302
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,494
I want to try that.

303
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:11,332
Eh?

304
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,838
Arai just went downstairs, right?
