1
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,354
It's truly pitiful.

2
00:00:05,194 --> 00:00:07,274
"They" even

3
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:12,474
take in a child like you.

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:15,194
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:18,514
What do you mean by a product
of "Sabaramond"?

6
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,534
Is Mr. Sabaramond here too?

7
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:25,194
Are you the people from
the Empire over that world too?

8
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:29,214
Or, are you related
to the Kingdom of Nyanild?

9
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:33,114
I have never heard of this term before.

10
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:35,534
Are you playing dumb with me?

11
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:39,954
WATCH OUT FOR FIRES
No, that's not right.It shouldn't be like that.

12
00:00:40,894 --> 00:00:44,354
Are you not in cahoots with those people?

13
00:00:45,094 --> 00:00:47,954
No, it's the same. It's enemy.

14
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:53,394
Who are you, Polka Shinoyama?

15
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:57,254
Damn it, there's no way
to communicate with him.

16
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:00,774
The text on the walls was just welded on.

17
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,514
Could it be that he's nearby,
observing the situation here?

18
00:01:04,834 --> 00:01:06,514
There's no one else on this floor.

19
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:09,634
On the floor below, there is only Sayo.

20
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:12,174
There are a few people
around the building.

21
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:14,954
There are two people on the rooftop?

22
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:17,154
Uh, huh?

23
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,714
You're quite impressive, young man!

27
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,354
You truly surprised me.

28
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,154
You possess the talent
to become a magician.

POUNDING IN THE HEART

30
00:03:14,334 --> 00:03:16,674
Who on earth is this kid?

31
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:20,594
Goddess of Luck, please grant me
smooth communication with him.

32
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:23,634
What's the deal with this guy?

33
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,954
He's clearly slower than Heilei,

34
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,134
but I can't figure out his moves.
He's really tough to deal with.

35
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:32,174
What exactly is his purpose for
coming to see Polka?

36
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,534
Or perhaps he's here to
find the fake Polka?

37
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:37,194
Let me trick him into
telling me some information.

38
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:40,394
So, old man, what are you here for?

39
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:45,134
Are you looking for Hosorogi?

40
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:50,914
Although I don't know who it is,
let me make use of it.

41
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:53,174
Hozologi, thank you.

42
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:58,074
Wow, you actually saw through everything.

43
00:03:58,574 --> 00:03:59,754
Fine.

44
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:03,414
I owe Hozologi a favor. I'll find another
opportunity to repay the favor.

45
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:04,734
That's settled then!

46
00:04:04,934 --> 00:04:07,874
Good luck and good night. Goddess of Luck!

47
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,934
You owe Hosorogi a favor?

48
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:14,734
Why would the prosecutor help
a wanted criminal like you?

49
00:04:17,334 --> 00:04:20,894
Is it possible that the police sniping
was self-directed?

50
00:04:22,034 --> 00:04:23,774
I didn't expect that
I would make the wrong choice!

51
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:27,674
PHEW
Wake up, Goddess of Luck!

52
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:30,094
His heart rate increased.

53
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:31,714
Because what I said was right?

54
00:04:33,994 --> 00:04:35,874
Such a pity.

55
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:39,134
ROUGH SELF-INVENTED WORDS
That sniper attack was undeniably "other-directed".

56
00:04:39,474 --> 00:04:42,974
LANGUAGE STRUCTURE CONFUSION
However, since I was targeted for a sniper attack,

57
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,714
it indicates that something
has happened to Hozologi.

58
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,894
This worries me greatly,

59
00:04:48,114 --> 00:04:50,554
LANGUAGE STRUCTURE CONFUSION
so I came here to see if I could find any clues.

60
00:04:50,954 --> 00:04:51,974
I see.

61
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:55,334
POLKA, HOSOROGI, OLD MAN
So what exactly is his relationship with Hosorogi?

62
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:57,594
Forget it.

63
00:04:58,854 --> 00:05:00,614
Regardless of whether
he is the enemy of Master,

64
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,194
I will find ways to capture him
and make him confess honestly.

65
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:06,334
Oh my, oh my, it seems like
you're not ready to give up.

66
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:10,354
I advise you to dismiss this idea.
This time, it's your turn to be startled.

67
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:12,894
That's really something
to look forward to.

68
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:16,834
I wonder what you will use to startle me!

69
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:32,174
Lemmings!

70
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,814
Like an urban legend,
the Jack-of-All-Trades stops at nothing.

71
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:37,454
A monster. The true identity
remains unknown.

72
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:39,614
My clan, the Heilei,

73
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:42,834
was under strict orders
not to lay a hand on him.

74
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:46,634
Could it be that
he is your comrade, old man?

75
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,474
I was right, wasn't I?
You were indeed startled.

76
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:54,974
I was startled too.

77
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:56,754
He is a dangerous man.

78
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,634
Even I can't understand
what he intends to do.

79
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:01,434
I truly don't understand.

80
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,554
If you want to surrender
and run away, do it now.

81
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:06,274
ESCAPE ROUTE, ABOVE
I want to run away too.

82
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,014
I know who you are.

83
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,634
I do not know your real name,
but you are called "Lemmings."

84
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:12,594
You possess extraordinary skills,
and your profession is unknown.

85
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:14,714
The enigmatic baby-face boy,

86
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,534
don't provoke
the fierce warrior over there.

87
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:19,784
NOT A SINGLE LIE
Once he makes a move,

88
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,614
NOT A SINGLE LIE
even I can't stop him.

89
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:26,674
Ah, am I going to die?

90
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,534
He's full of flaws.

91
00:06:34,154 --> 00:06:36,854
Do the guards of Lord Rozan
know about Lemmings?

92
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,734
I haven't told my family
the details about you guys.

93
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:44,954
Perhaps someone saw Lemmings
during the previous fire incident.

94
00:06:46,434 --> 00:06:47,494
If so…

95
00:06:47,554 --> 00:06:48,514
Don't worry.

96
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:51,454
I won't do anything
that would hurt our own people.

97
00:06:52,274 --> 00:06:54,634
I have carefully instructed Lemmings

98
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:56,734
not to harm my Grandpa's guards.

99
00:06:57,674 --> 00:07:00,534
As long as it is my command,
he will definitely obey.

100
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,454
No matter what happens.

101
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:07,154
What's going on?

102
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,434
What's the matter with this guy?

103
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,214
Ignoring me?

104
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:22,994
It is uncuttable.

105
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:28,774
Then, how about this?

106
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,274
Normally, shouldn't you charge
towards the enemy using electric shocks to you

107
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:46,894
with the determination to die together?

108
00:07:47,294 --> 00:07:50,874
I really want to sound the alarm
for young people like you in this modern society

109
00:07:50,914 --> 00:07:52,534
who don't even care
about getting electrocuted.

110
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,514
So he's not your comrade at all.

111
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:58,554
That's hard to say.

112
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:02,464
For me, everything in my surrounding
environment is considered a comrade.

113
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:05,374
That means both the person
wrapped in bandages

114
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:07,934
and you can be called my comrades.

115
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:11,074
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
Let's just stop killing each other.

116
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:14,734
Why don't we communicate
with each other to solve the problem?

117
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:17,074
You've been playing
boring tricks since earlier.

118
00:08:17,574 --> 00:08:20,954
I've had enough.
I'll just knock both of you out.

119
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:31,094
Can I have a moment of your time, miss?

120
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:35,154
We are not suspicious individuals.

121
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,214
We are Shinjuku Police's Community
Safety Division officers.

122
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:41,034
I'm curious why you're dressed like this

123
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,254
when it's not raining at all.

124
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:46,234
A young child walks the streets
at three in the morning.

125
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:49,714
As a police officer,
I cannot turn a blind eye to it.

126
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:53,568
WATCH OUT FOR FIRES

127
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,634
CALL ENDED

128
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,654
He hangs up.

129
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,154
What's going on? What happened?

130
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,194
Although it's just fragmented information,

131
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:04,074
the intelligence from the world I once
lived in has indeed spread over here.

132
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:07,854
A product of Sabaramond?

133
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:10,154
The world I escaped from

134
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,734
holds precious memories of

135
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:15,674
irreplaceable people and me,

136
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:19,594
the world's enemy who cannot turn back.

137
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,654
Stop! Don't touch it.

138
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:24,394
Don't tarnish it.

139
00:09:31,474 --> 00:09:32,474
Among those few people on the rooftop,

140
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:34,994
one is undoubtedly Lemmings.

141
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:37,314
Meanwhile, the person downstairs
seems extremely frantic.

142
00:09:38,934 --> 00:09:41,274
Just after hanging up the phone,
this situation occurred.

143
00:09:41,974 --> 00:09:44,554
It indicates that the person
I was talking to is very likely nearby.

144
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,634
I can't overlook any possible
clue at the moment.

145
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,394
The first thing to do is to

146
00:09:54,934 --> 00:09:57,554
control the current situation.

147
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,594
What's wrong, Romelka?

148
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,814
Easlies.

149
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:21,274
Why have you been gazing at the sea?

150
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:23,934
I'm just immersed in sadness, that's all.

151
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:27,094
I recall the pitiful yet elegant empire

152
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:29,054
THE FORMER SECOND-RANKED IMPERIAL COURT SORCERER TO THE BYANDY EMPIRE
that perished over a hundred years ago.

153
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:30,394
WANDERING BALCONY, EASLIES SWORDFRAIL
that perished over a hundred years ago.

154
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,594
ROAMING WOODLANDS, SEVENTH-RANKED
You're lying. Stop lying.

155
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:37,674
ROMELKA RIMELKA
You're thinking about
Corpse God, aren't you?

156
00:10:38,194 --> 00:10:39,174
It doesn't make a difference.

157
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,114
All I did in the empire was

158
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:45,314
nurturing that foolish disciple.

159
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:47,634
This achievement is truly remarkable!

160
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:51,714
It is unusual for a master and a disciple
to both be court wizards.

161
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,974
I only took over my master's position
after he retired.

162
00:10:56,254 --> 00:10:58,754
Corpse God, known for
his unparalleled strength,

163
00:10:58,974 --> 00:11:01,634
utilizes necromancy
that is distinct from yours.

164
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:04,134
It's just like entrusting each other's
backs to one another

165
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:06,154
as master and disciple,
which is truly exhilarating.

166
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:09,114
I can even feel the magic wandering
through veins. It's simply irresistible.

167
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:14,194
Even after a hundred years,
you still remain unruly.

168
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,734
By utilizing magic
to extend your lifespan,

169
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:19,434
your growth has also slowed down.

170
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,694
Perhaps that foolish disciple will

171
00:11:25,014 --> 00:11:26,974
always be a "youth" until the end.

172
00:11:27,974 --> 00:11:30,994
Isn't that great? Forever being a child.

173
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:34,814
Corpse God is usually a very good child.

174
00:11:35,274 --> 00:11:37,394
However, once he enters
the battlefield, he changes.

175
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,994
A good child. A good child?

176
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:42,514
No, you've got it wrong,

177
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:44,874
and you're completely mistaken.

178
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:50,054
That foolish disciple
surpasses me in one aspect.

179
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,074
He is capable of empathy.

180
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:53,474
Empathy?

181
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:55,574
Although he himself is not aware of this,

182
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,734
he lacks autonomy almost entirely.

183
00:11:59,674 --> 00:12:03,234
He entrusts himself entirely to
those he considers companions.

184
00:12:04,754 --> 00:12:05,774
Perhaps it is precisely because of this

185
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,464
that he surpasses me in the aspect of
synchronizing with the deceased.

186
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:13,334
Therefore, precisely because of this,

187
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,474
even if he is treated unfairly,
he doesn't care at all.

188
00:12:18,194 --> 00:12:20,334
However, once the "sanctuary"
he relies on is defiled,

189
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,894
that fellow, the Corpse God,

190
00:12:25,274 --> 00:12:26,834
will completely lose control.

191
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,894
Although I don't know what happened,

192
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:47,234
I was advised to pay attention to
the condition of the building.

193
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,074
It's quite chilling to see
a high school girl wearing a raincoat

194
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:51,674
when it's not raining at all.

195
00:12:52,454 --> 00:12:54,074
After all, we have the example
of The Gator Sisters.

196
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:56,154
Even if it is a girl,
I should not take it lightly.

197
00:13:01,674 --> 00:13:02,774
I'm very sorry.

198
00:13:03,414 --> 00:13:05,894
Actually, it's because our dog
ran away from home,

199
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,574
so my father and I came here
together to look for it.

200
00:13:09,174 --> 00:13:11,854
It seems like it ran into this building.

201
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,014
Where is your father?

202
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:19,054
He called just now and said
he found our dog, Toyomaru.

203
00:13:19,434 --> 00:13:20,554
I think it won't be long
before my father comes back.

204
00:13:21,174 --> 00:13:22,234
Here he is.

205
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:24,374
Dad.

206
00:13:24,914 --> 00:13:26,254
What do you want from my daughter?

207
00:13:26,654 --> 00:13:28,614
Dad, don't make that expression.

208
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:30,714
They are police officers.

209
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,454
Sorry for my rudeness.

210
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,594
I am here with my daughter
looking for our dog.

211
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,414
Why do you need to wear raincoat?

212
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:40,694
To avoid soiling the clothes worn
when searching in tight spaces.

213
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,434
No, there are no living dogs nearby.

214
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,934
I am somewhat familiar

215
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:53,014
with the color of the girl's soul who had
a conversation with the police officer

216
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:54,854
and the color of the man's soul
who confronted Lemmings on the rooftop.

217
00:13:55,974 --> 00:13:56,974
Both of them asked about

218
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:59,794
the "emblem" during divination.

219
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,714
This is not a coincidence.

220
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:04,834
I'll expand the temple more.

221
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:14,544
What's wrong?

222
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:17,354
Hey, don't you feel cold?

223
00:14:22,574 --> 00:14:26,314
Young man, let's review the basics today.

224
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,474
Let's start with The Netherworld,

225
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,634
also known as the construction
of the temple.

226
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:37,074
Have you ever felt the forest covered
in silence at night to be eerie?

227
00:14:37,674 --> 00:14:42,834
As if in a temple,
the atmosphere is sacred.

228
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:45,194
Necromancers only need to overflow

229
00:14:45,514 --> 00:14:49,214
netherworld air into an enclosed space

230
00:14:49,754 --> 00:14:51,054
or the necromancer's surroundings

231
00:14:51,394 --> 00:14:54,674
to freely create an "atmosphere" that may
be unseen but can be felt to some extent.

232
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,514
The sensation described is incredibly
subtle for individuals without Evil Eye.

233
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,934
If you devote enough time to the ritual,

234
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:06,374
the ritual can be used to confuse
others' vision and orientation.

235
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:12,754
Your current level is
approximately at this stage.

236
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:16,514
Don't be impatient, young man.

237
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,434
If you continue to cultivate and train,

238
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:24,074
there will come a day
when you can encompass an entire city.

239
00:15:26,954 --> 00:15:29,434
Did you feel it suddenly gets so cold?

240
00:15:30,154 --> 00:15:33,154
Oh my, even though
I'm not sure what's going on,

241
00:15:33,694 --> 00:15:36,274
this atmosphere makes
me feel a bit uneasy.

242
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:39,674
The "Lemmings" is on the rooftop,

243
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:42,654
and I don't want to confront him directly.

244
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:46,034
But both the rooftop
and the entrance below

245
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,774
have had people asking about the emblem.

246
00:15:49,734 --> 00:15:51,454
If they have some kind of
clue in their hands,

247
00:15:52,014 --> 00:15:53,434
I absolutely cannot let them escape.

248
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:56,854
First, I need to support Xiaoyu.

249
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
WE WILL BE SEEN BY THE PEOPLE AROUND

250
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:02,514
Don't worry.

251
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:05,734
What I'm about to do now is to unleash
the "Swarm of Invisible Hands."

252
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:08,234
What's going on here?

253
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:11,034
The atmosphere around suddenly changed.

254
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,074
It feels like sinking
to the bottom of a lake.

255
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,294
Although the scenery remains unchanged,

256
00:16:17,934 --> 00:16:20,674
there is definitely something different.

257
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:25,014
Could it be that someone
released some kind of gas?

258
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:26,434
No, that's not it.

259
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:29,554
This thing has no effect on the body.

260
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:32,574
It simply makes people feel uncomfortable.

261
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,334
I should probably
leave this place right now.

262
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,054
Ah… by the way,

263
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:43,354
let me ask first,

264
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:45,434
which one of you did this?

265
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:47,854
How could I possibly know?

266
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:57,354
What just happened? What's going on?

267
00:16:57,974 --> 00:17:01,294
Even in such an extraordinary situation,
you are still targeting me?

268
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:03,454
What?

269
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,154
What's going on? There has been something
since then that's hindering us.

270
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:13,674
From what I observed,
that young man didn't make any moves.

271
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:18,654
In other words, that thing has a clear
purpose and is specifically targeting us.

272
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:21,114
The condition is very good.

273
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:25,994
Sharing sensations
or sympathizing with the dead is easy.

274
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:30,374
Even within the Temple
that is currently unfolding,

275
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:32,334
it is not difficult to operate precisely
within The Netherworld's borders.

276
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:35,434
So, let's move on to the next stage.

277
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:41,174
Although I'm very interested,
let's end the playtime with you tonight.

278
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:43,854
Até breve obri…
What's the next sentence again?

279
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:48,294
Oh dear, it seems like
one thing after another.

280
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:55,254
As expected, if it's just me,
I can't effectively advertise.

281
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:56,672
Recruiting!

282
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:58,974
HERE
I need extras to play the role of ropes.

283
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,794
Ah, it looks like I should report
this matter to Mr. Iwa.

284
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:04,494
That shouldn't be a problem.

285
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:06,454
But where are you going to start?

286
00:18:06,524 --> 00:18:07,414
What?

287
00:18:09,234 --> 00:18:11,654
That is also a trick of Solitaire, right?

288
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,554
Hahaha, it's hard to say.

289
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:16,974
My secret blend of smoke

290
00:18:17,314 --> 00:18:20,794
combines tapioca powder to
recreate the taste of pearl milk tea.

291
00:18:22,494 --> 00:18:23,954
This is…

292
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:28,514
This is the necromancy I have created
by adapting to the world here.

293
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:31,854
Yes?

294
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:34,934
I'm sending the video over now.
Please watch it immediately.

295
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,074
What happened?

296
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:39,434
Given the current situation,
I find it difficult to make a judgment.

297
00:18:42,594 --> 00:18:43,694
What did you say?

298
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:47,994
Establishing perceptual sharing through
Sympathizing with the Dead and Spirit-of-the-Dead Thread.

299
00:18:48,574 --> 00:18:50,014
This was not successfully
achieved in my previous world

300
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:52,894
due to obstacles from
abundant magical elements.

301
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:56,994
You're here too, the Firestarter?

302
00:18:57,454 --> 00:19:00,714
You misdirected me, quite skilled indeed.

303
00:19:01,294 --> 00:19:03,754
Fine. You ask me why I don't mind?

304
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:07,434
That's because I'm in
a great mood right now.

305
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,214
Although it hasn't been confirmed yet,

306
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:14,474
the bridge forged by immense hope is now
shining brightly before me like a rainbow.

307
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:17,534
Due to the lack of magical elements in
this world, this move is easy to perform.

308
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,834
And in order to enable
interference at physical level,

309
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,094
I will weave the Threads
in the hands of the necromancer.

310
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:27,314
This extraordinary technique exploits
the unique environment of this world.

311
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,134
I shall name it
the Swarm of Invisible Hands.

312
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,474
Time passes, conventions are shattered.

313
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:41,334
This world is truly magnificent!

314
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:53,034
The energy I output is still not enough
to suppress Lemmings.

315
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,014
In that case, I will deal with
the other person first.

316
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:59,074
The imaged middle schooler inside me

317
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,254
is cheering and jumping with joy.

318
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:04,334
Are the "bones" and "arms" at the scene

319
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,194
of the fire of the same origin?

320
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,034
And do you hold this secret?

321
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:11,374
I see.

322
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:14,034
Your title carries no hint of falsehood.

323
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:15,554
I will see you again.

324
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:21,014
Corpse God, I will surely
expose your true identity.

325
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:28,174
As for you, if possible,
I really don't want to see you again,

326
00:20:28,814 --> 00:20:30,374
Lemmings.

327
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,094
DID HE ESCAPE?

328
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:37,414
The person on the rooftop has escaped,

329
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,674
but I got the one downstairs.

330
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,290
THIS INCIDENT IS SO SHOCKING, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

331
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,290
WHO DID IT?

332
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,370
THERE WON'T BE ANY MISTAKES

333
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,864
ANOTHER PARANORMAL PHENOMENON APPEARED?
IS IT RELATED TO THE PREVIOUS FIRE INCIDENT?

334
00:20:58,016 --> 00:20:58,656
BONES WERE MOVING IN THE FIRE?

335
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,454
-That is a mysterious power passed down from ancient times.
-Sacred arts, necromancy, elven arts.

336
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:05,954
Those are the secret arts of our
ancestors, which we have yet to master.

337
00:21:05,994 --> 00:21:07,974
-Lost power.
-A power that guides us towards a new stage.

338
00:21:07,974 --> 00:21:10,094
-It must be governed.
-It is both power and duty.

339
00:21:10,154 --> 00:21:12,814
-Explore, explore, search.
-Explore, debate, discover, seize.

340
00:21:12,884 --> 00:21:14,334
We must obtain it.

341
00:21:14,658 --> 00:21:16,084
I UNDERSTAND, MY FELLOW BRETHREN,
WE WILL TRY TO USE THE PIECES IN OUR HANDS

342
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:17,504
AS LONG AS THE PIECES ARE USED CORRECTLY,
THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED SIMULTANEOUSLY

343
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:18,944
HOW IRONIC IT IS

344
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,418
TO MY SURPRISE, INSIDE THE BUILDING
WHERE HOSOROGI WAS ELIMINATED

345
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:21,888
THERE WAS ACTUALLY A GATHERING OF INDIVIDUALS
WHO INHERITED HIS WILL

346
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,474
Is that so? I got it.

347
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:28,834
Anyway, you take control
of the scene, Yatsu.

348
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,634
It seems like
the police are taking action.

349
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:35,334
This city was originally bustling.

350
00:21:37,294 --> 00:21:39,194
It looks like it's going to
become noisy again.

351
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:24,354
Things are getting interesting, Sister.

352
00:23:36,064 --> 00:23:37,120
(Dead Mount, Death Play S2)

353
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,748
SEE YOU IN OCTOBER
