1
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:18,354
We'd like you to make a contract
with the Devil in this cell.

2
00:00:19,438 --> 00:00:21,482
It's the Future Devil.

3
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:24,777
Two people in Public Safety
have a contract with it.

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,612
One of them gave half their lifespan.

5
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:30,199
The other gave it their eyes
and their senses of taste and smell.

6
00:00:31,784 --> 00:00:33,869
If it likes you,
you might get a better deal.

7
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,708
There you go.

8
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:05,276
The future rules.

9
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,072
The future rules…

10
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:39,995
CHAINSAW MAN

11
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:47,002
The future rules…

12
00:02:48,087 --> 00:02:50,422
Say it too! The future rules!

13
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:52,841
I'm here to make a contract with you.

14
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:55,803
Tell me what you want from me.

15
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,183
Your attitude is the worst ever!

16
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,686
Whatever. Show me your future!

17
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,190
The details of a contract
depend on the future.

18
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,068
Hurry up and stick your head in my belly.

19
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:13,821
Otherwise I can't see your future.

20
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,972
Here is the contract.

21
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,599
Let me live in your right eye.

22
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:45,686
And I'll help you.

23
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,608
You must be thinking, "That's it?"

24
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:55,863
Because you'll die in
the worst possible way.

25
00:03:57,114 --> 00:03:59,741
You must be curious how you'll die.

26
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,410
-You will--
-Don't bother.

27
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:04,788
I'm not interested in knowing.

28
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:07,958
As long as I can kill
those I want to kill,

29
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,376
I don't care what comes after.

30
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,961
Hurry up and get in my eye.

31
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,514
Okay.

32
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:25,476
I give your moves a perfect score.

33
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:29,146
From now on,
you don't need to train every day.

34
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,648
We'll do it once a week.

35
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:33,484
Yay.

36
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:34,902
Great.

37
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:38,780
Keep a cool head
even when you get excited.

38
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:43,660
Always remember
your weapons and the situation.

39
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,164
In light of your training,
you'll have real combat tomorrow.

40
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:49,291
Real combat?

41
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,961
We're going to capture
the ones who killed Himeno and others,

42
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:55,297
which are Katana Man and the snake girl.

43
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:58,217
It'll be the new Division 4's debut.

44
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,803
If the mission fails,
Division 4 will be finished.

45
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:08,685
And you two will be put down
via a real battle with me.

46
00:05:11,772 --> 00:05:16,068
If that happens,
I'll let you go without killing you.

47
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,694
What?

48
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:20,197
Because you made me stronger.

49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,574
Now I can kill more Devils.

50
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:25,827
And if I do that,
I'll get a date with Ms. Makima.

51
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:36,546
Good work. I know you've been quite busy.

52
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:40,926
I hope you can keep
training Denji and Power.

53
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:46,807
I'm sick of them already.

54
00:05:48,684 --> 00:05:52,229
Every time a dog I trained dies,
I drink more alcohol.

55
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:57,651
I thought I wouldn't feel guilty
even if the toys broke…

56
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:02,781
But my mind's gotten weak with age.
I get attached to toys.

57
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,621
So, what did you want to talk about?

58
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,291
The ambush on the Special Divisions…

59
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,710
Public Safety folks are no fools.

60
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:18,588
You knew about it
and let it happen, right?

61
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,758
I was ambushed too.

62
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:27,764
Whatever inhuman things you do,
or even if you kill my dogs,

63
00:06:27,848 --> 00:06:31,601
as long as you're still on
the humans' side, I'll leave you alone.

64
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:35,355
Only as long as that's true.

65
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:41,611
All I want is to save as many people
from the Devils as possible.

66
00:06:42,612 --> 00:06:45,032
If this mission succeeds,

67
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:49,036
Division 4 will be all over the news.

68
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,040
And then we'll have more
freedom to operate

69
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:55,292
and save more people from the Devils.

70
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,046
Liar.

71
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:18,065
We had the big boss move to the villa.

72
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,608
You should go too, sir…

73
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:23,320
As long as Makima's alive,
there's nowhere to hide in Japan.

74
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:25,656
We're prepared to meet the enemy here.

75
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,199
Keep quiet.

76
00:07:27,282 --> 00:07:28,617
Shut up, girl!

77
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,618
Sir.

78
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:34,956
If Grandpa were here,
he'd never stand for running away.

79
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,959
And that damn Denji is in Division 4.

80
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:40,921
I have to rip out his heart this time!

81
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:44,383
No need to worry about your leader.

82
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:46,218
He can be revived anyway.

83
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,806
If you're staying here,
worry about not getting bitten instead.

84
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:52,474
Bitten?

85
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,725
What does that mean?

86
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,729
<i>Our secret weapon is underneath.</i>

87
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,109
<i>Grandpa's gift when he died.</i>

88
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,737
<i>A zombie army made of scum
who couldn't pay back their debts.</i>

89
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:09,116
Humans bitten by zombies
will turn into zombies.

90
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,910
That's how we'll finish Division 4.

91
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:19,209
We're going back to Kyoto
once we're done sightseeing.

92
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:21,878
We'll probably never see you again.

93
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:24,214
So let me ask you a question.

94
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,634
I heard you are after the Gun Devil.

95
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:30,429
Do you really think you can kill it?

96
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:35,642
You lost to an enemy who killed
around 20 members of the Special Division.

97
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,519
What makes you think

98
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,147
you can defeat the Devil that killed
millions around the world?

99
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,233
Our lives were ruined by
the Gun Devil too.

100
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:46,153
That's why we joined Public Safety.

101
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,282
<i>But we don't even consider
killing the Gun Devil.</i>

102
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,118
<i>Anyone in their rational mind
knows it's impossible.</i>

103
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,623
To be honest, you make me angry.

104
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:03,003
You are so weak, yet you give yourself
a goal like the main character of a manga.

105
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:05,088
It's so cringy. It gives me goosebumps.

106
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,758
See? I've got them for real.

107
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:09,009
No.

108
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:17,309
Keep that gibberish to yourself.

109
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:19,978
You just stand back and watch.

110
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:24,191
When I lose and die,
you can come laugh at me.

111
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:29,362
I'm aware that I'm lost already.

112
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:31,072
But…

113
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:34,284
I also know that I couldn't go on living
if I didn't do this.

114
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:47,297
Thank you for the advice.

115
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:53,595
Aki!

116
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:58,809
You are one annoying bastard,
but I'm rooting for you.

117
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:00,894
I'll give you one last piece of advice.

118
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,232
Everyone in the Special Divisions
is insane, so watch out.

119
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,376
Our guest is from Public Safety?

120
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,919
Bring us the best tea.

121
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:28,672
Thank you for your cooperation.

122
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:33,510
Some of our youngbloods went rogue
and fired guns in Tokyo.

123
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,929
I'll answer all your questions.

124
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:39,641
I hope you can understand
that I did not order this hit.

125
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,188
I heard the one behind it all
is this Sawatari girl.

126
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:52,237
This girl's been tricking our youngsters
into making a contract with the Gun Devil.

127
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:54,573
What are the terms of the contract?

128
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:57,993
In exchange for 20,000 yen
to the Gun Devil,

129
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:01,079
they can get guns and ammo.

130
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,749
Devils need money
in their world too, right?

131
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:08,086
They're not so different
from humans after all.

132
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,968
Please write down the name of everyone
who has a contract with the Gun Devil.

133
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,928
Oh, sure.

134
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:20,098
Throw them in jail
and teach them a lesson.

135
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,976
Not only in your organization.

136
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:25,478
I need the names of those
from other syndicates too.

137
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,858
Miss.

138
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:33,862
You don't have a clue
how things work here.

139
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,447
Even if I knew those names,

140
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,576
we'd have a war on our hands
if they found out that I squealed.

141
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,620
Ridiculous.

142
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:43,788
It's for the safety of the public.

143
00:11:44,497 --> 00:11:45,999
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

144
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:58,386
Miss…

145
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,015
Do you know what necessary evil is?

146
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:05,393
If different organizations
go to war with each other,

147
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:09,522
foreign mafias would find
their way into Japan.

148
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:13,026
I admit we do some bad things.

149
00:12:13,109 --> 00:12:17,781
But the Chinese and Russian mafias
are far worse than us.

150
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:20,283
We're the ones keeping them out.

151
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:31,252
Just like that you Devil Hunters
keep humans safe from Devils,

152
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:35,799
we yakuza keep the Japanese people
safe from foreigners.

153
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,678
They say many Devil Hunters
are uneducated idiots.

154
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,680
So it's natural you wouldn't understand.

155
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:50,647
I won't betray my own
for some jump change.

156
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:53,024
This is not money.

157
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,111
It's everyone here's…

158
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:57,487
fathers', mothers',

159
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,489
grandmothers', grandfathers',

160
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,491
brothers', sisters',

161
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:04,119
lovers' or wives'

162
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:05,704
eyes.

163
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:07,747
Eyes?

164
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:16,798
Don't worry.

165
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:20,135
We have someone in Public Safety
that can put their eyes back.

166
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,304
If you can be so kind as to cooperate,
I'll introduce them…

167
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,556
You…

168
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,699
The necessary evil you talked about

169
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:46,411
is just an excuse to justify your crimes.

170
00:13:47,036 --> 00:13:49,789
Our society doesn't need those excuses.

171
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,542
The truly necessary evils

172
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,212
are always kept collared
and controlled by the state.

173
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:02,886
Division 2 and the police have surrounded
the basement and the ground floor exits.

174
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,765
Division 4 will be responsible
for suppression inside the building.

175
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:11,728
Kill as many Public Safety members
as possible, and take Denji's heart.

176
00:14:11,811 --> 00:14:16,483
At least the two of us should be able
to escape afterward if I use the snake.

177
00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:19,486
I'll kill Denji.

178
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,404
Don't get too excited.

179
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:24,991
METROPOLITAN POLICE

180
00:14:28,328 --> 00:14:29,579
I want to go home.

181
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,831
Go home then.

182
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:34,501
I had training,

183
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:38,088
so I'll kill that guy
with hair on his temples.

184
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:41,257
The training even made us smarter.

185
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:42,675
Easy peasy.

186
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,639
I want to go home.

187
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:55,396
What's the plan?

188
00:14:56,106 --> 00:14:57,357
There is no plan.

189
00:14:58,358 --> 00:14:59,651
We're throwing everyone
in the Special Division

190
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,736
at that building.

191
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:12,163
WATCH OUT FOR EXITING VEHICLES

192
00:15:12,247 --> 00:15:13,248
Excuse me.

193
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:17,210
I'm Lieutenant Shiina
from Kanagawa police.

194
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,420
I'm Furuno from Division 2.

195
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,924
I'm the captain of Division 4, Kishibe.

196
00:15:23,591 --> 00:15:27,679
The police and Division 2 will be blocking
the ground floor and basement exits.

197
00:15:28,263 --> 00:15:31,516
Division 4 will go in
to subdue the terrorists.

198
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,521
There's only one thing
you should be aware of.

199
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:41,276
Most of the members
in Division 4 are non-humans.

200
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:47,198
If we let them escape, the damage
will be worse than a terrorist attack.

201
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:54,080
You need to be prepared for
a battle against Division 4 as well.

202
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,374
<i>I'll give you the rundown on our members.</i>

203
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,210
Zombies…

204
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:05,091
Eat them all!

205
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:11,306
<i>Shark Fiend.</i>

206
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,807
<i>This one can swim on any surface.</i>

207
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:14,726
<i>The walls, the ground, anything.</i>

208
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,396
<i>He can take the form of a Devil
for a short period.</i>

209
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:25,528
Ouch.

210
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,073
Oh, my bad.

211
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,951
You tried to bite me,
so I thought you were a zombie.

212
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,748
<i>Violence Fiend.</i>

213
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:40,335
<i>Normally, they should be weaker
as Fiends than they are as Devils.</i>

214
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,670
<i>But this one is still
too strong as a Fiend,</i>

215
00:16:42,754 --> 00:16:44,923
<i>so we make him wear
a poison-dispensing mask.</i>

216
00:16:45,924 --> 00:16:47,967
<i>Do not remove that mask
under any circumstances.</i>

217
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,680
Hey, lady! You'd better run.

218
00:16:52,764 --> 00:16:55,433
You'll turn into a zombie
if you get bitten.

219
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,771
Oh, you're a Devil.

220
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,276
<i>Spider Devil.</i>

221
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,987
<i>She usually takes a human shape.</i>

222
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:11,741
<i>Devils with humanlike appearances
tend to be friendly to humans,</i>

223
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:13,243
<i>but a Devil's a Devil.</i>

224
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,204
She kills people when she's mad.

225
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:24,587
You got my shoes dirty.

226
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:26,589
What a jerk.

227
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:33,846
<i>Angel Devil.</i>

228
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,890
<i>This one is special.</i>

229
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:38,351
<i>A Devil who's not hostile toward humans.
But do not approach.</i>

230
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,187
<i>Touch this one and
your lifespan gets absorbed.</i>

231
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,952
Hey, you. Got a handkerchief?

232
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,882
Why do you get so close to me?

233
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,552
Your life will be shortened
if you touch me.

234
00:18:13,553 --> 00:18:15,471
Not through cloth, right?

235
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:18,850
That one hurt.

236
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,316
Devil! Move him outside!

237
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:28,151
You're ordering me around.

238
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:31,696
Well, still better than fighting, I guess.

239
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,613
You guys.

240
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:35,575
Leave this to the Fiends.

241
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,994
We're going after Katana Man
and the snake girl.

242
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,204
What? Do you know where they are?

243
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,373
No.

244
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,624
We'll go separately.

245
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:39,615
Surrender now--

246
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:40,575
Snake.

247
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:42,160
Spit it out.

248
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,548
Son of a…

249
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,429
Ghost.

250
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,181
Kill him.

251
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:21,491
Your moves have improved.

252
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,701
If you use my power,

253
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,871
your right eye will see
a sliver into the future.

254
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:47,058
But that's all.

255
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,538
Strangle him to death.
