1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,390
Thorkell must be behind this!

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,770
I can't think of anyone else.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,770
But Lord Floki,
the mesage from Derby said--

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,280
There are too few on the left!
Don't underestimate 500 warriors!

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,990
We're up against Thorkell!

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,240
Lord Floki, if the reports are true,
doing this would be sedition.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,830
Unbelievable.

8
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,870
To think Prince Canute
would return home with Thorkell in tow.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,790
It's inconceivable!

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,800
Hey, Floki!

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,640
Want to fight? I'll be your opponent.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,890
Stand down, Thorkell.

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,690
I sent an envoy ahead of my arrival
announcing my return home, Floki.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,150
Are you greeting me with spears in hand?

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,110
No, I would never intend
to do something so…

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,740
Askeladd!

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,200
What are you doing here?

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,700
Have your ears stopped working?

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,290
I am asking you
if you intend to point your arrows

20
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,580
at a member of Danish royalty.

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,460
No, that's…

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,050
We Jomsvikings

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,720
received a false report
of an enemy army attack.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,310
I am deeply sorry.

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,980
Report back that I plan to visit
the king's estate in the evening.

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,940
Be accurate.

27
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,120
What the hell just happened?

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,330
He's a completely different person.

29
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,930
DANISH ARMY MAIN BASE
GAINSBOROUGH CASTLE

30
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,180
All of you. Walk with me and listen.

31
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,230
Today, we cannot start any fights.

32
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,690
I have few allies among these men.

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,770
Any provocation will make us traitors.

34
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,940
We need time to form a plan.

35
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,530
Thorkell,

36
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,120
you've betrayed them once,
but you remain popular with the warriors.

37
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,080
I want you to interact with the heads
of each clan to restore relations.

38
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,080
Are you saying

39
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,540
you want me to go on
a drinking binge at your expense?

40
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,090
Ensure that the other leaders join. Go.

41
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,470
What a terrific order!

42
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,510
I was right to follow you.

43
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,640
Let's go!

44
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,020
Askeladd, come with me to see the king.

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,560
I want your assessment of him.

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,480
Understood.

47
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,070
How do you think we should proceed
from here on out?

48
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:23,980
Well.

49
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,110
With limited time,
assassination is preferable.

50
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,160
Because your elder brother Prince Harald
is far away in Denmark,

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,490
there is an opportunity.

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,410
If the king met his demise now,

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,710
you would become commander-in-chief
to the English field army.

54
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,920
In this case, we'd need to cover
for the person behind the plot.

55
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,010
Thorfinn,

56
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,970
from here on, you will serve
as more than my protector.

57
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,060
I'm counting on you.

58
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,980
Don't order me around.

59
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,560
I don't recall agreeing to serve you.

60
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,020
Please forgive his impertinence.

61
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,570
I'll relay your orders to this dolt.

62
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,200
I wonder

63
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,370
if God

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,120
is watching us even now.

65
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,170
Losing friends,
parents and children killing each other…

66
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:33,050
God is watching us commit these acts
from high up in the heavens.

67
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,270
I'll never forgive him.

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,060
I will take this land
and turn it into a paradise.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
It will be peaceful, abundant,

70
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,900
and the ideal land
for those who suffer in life.

71
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,910
It may not happen in my generation,

72
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,620
but I will take the first step.

73
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,750
God will surely call me
to his side with love.

74
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,540
However,

75
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,710
when that happens, I will say,

76
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,090
"We have no need
of the Kingdom of Heaven or its trials.

77
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,680
Our paradise is here

78
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
on Earth."

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,350
We will regain what we have lost.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
If I must become a demon
to attain this goal. So be it.

81
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,900
I will assist you,

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,030
Your Highness.

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,460
I am pleased you have returned.

84
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
I am happy,

85
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,340
Canute.

86
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,430
I'm grateful for your words.

87
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,060
I am unworthy of them having lost
the soldiers you placed under my command.

88
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
Come closer.

89
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,650
Hold on.

90
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,150
Your assessment, Thorfinn?

91
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,740
They're here.

92
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,570
About 20 men.

93
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,740
There are also archers in the rafters.

94
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,490
Your Highness,

95
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,250
it is an ambush.

96
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,210
It seems the king has already
made up his mind as to how to proceed.

97
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,380
What's wrong?

98
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,590
Do you hesitate to approach?

99
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,390
You two, no matter what happens,
do not draw your swords.

100
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,640
The first to draw his sword will lose.

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,310
This is

102
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,140
that kind of fight.

103
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,330
My eyes have adjusted to the dark.

104
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,710
A little closer,
and I'll be able to see the king's face.

105
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,290
If I can see his face…

106
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Halt.

107
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,300
That's close enough.

108
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,130
Kneel.

109
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,430
He has tired eyes.

110
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,770
So this is the king of the Danes?

111
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Askeladd.

112
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:42,120
What happened to Ragnar?

113
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,370
I do not see him with you.

114
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,540
He died in Mercia.

115
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,130
I see. That is regrettable.

116
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,630
He was a most sincere and loyal retainer.

117
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,890
In a normal situation, we would be
toasting your return with food and drink.

118
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,100
However, I would like

119
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,730
to speak to you informally for a moment.

120
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,690
Canute only, rise.

121
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,610
Take ten steps forward.

122
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,710
In such a short time,

123
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,880
your face has changed.

124
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,260
You look like I did in my youth.

125
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:45,850
Then

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,640
you must also understand
my inner thoughts.

127
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,980
A burdensome child.

128
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,400
To think our likeness is so true
even in this regard.

129
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,480
Children

130
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,280
grow up watching their parents.

131
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,780
You mustn't blame yourself.

132
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,620
When I was young,

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,920
I drove my father, the late king,
out of the country

134
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,750
and I took this crown for myself.

135
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,590
I did it because I believed it was
for the good of the kingdom.

136
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,430
Although, he was
by nature cruel and a coward.

137
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,560
The world would be chaotic
if a man like that wore the crown.

138
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,860
How can he say that
when he's protected on all sides?

139
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,730
Silence. He can hear you.

140
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,450
You've decided against asserting
yourself by force, Your Highness?

141
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,410
Don't forget you're in the lion's den now.

142
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,790
I thought I did a good deed.

143
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,330
I believed I would bring prosperity,

144
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,000
until I put this on.

145
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,550
This crown on my head

146
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,090
has a will of its own.

147
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,060
Once you wear it, you command
1,000 ships and 10,000 warriors.

148
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:18,150
You can have any of the treasures
retrieved from distant lands.

149
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,360
You can feel a godlike power inside you.

150
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,200
However…

151
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,450
However, Canute,

152
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,750
it is not the king who wields this power.

153
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,710
This power is ruled
by the will of the crown.

154
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,340
Are you saying then
it was the crown who gave the order

155
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,680
to have me killed?

156
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,100
There are only two things
the crown wants from the king.

157
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,690
To use power and to increase power.

158
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,480
It is futile to fight it.

159
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,400
And the crown does not want you.

160
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,010
Canute,

161
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,930
I will grant you dominion of Cornwall.

162
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,690
There you may read the Holy Bible
and spend your days in tranquility.

163
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,110
If you refuse me now,

164
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,520
you can die here.

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,700
Is the crown forcing you
to say those words, Your Majesty?

166
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:52,950
Your Majesty!

167
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,790
Forgive my intrusion,
but I ask for permission to speak.

168
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,960
State your name.

169
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,040
I am Prince Canute's retainer,

170
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,960
son of Olaf, Askeladd.

171
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,340
Pardon me, but will your commands
fulfill the will of the crown?

172
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,430
Continue.

173
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,020
His Highness took Thorkell's army
from London and put it under his command.

174
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,530
If Your Majesty ascends
to the English throne,

175
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,530
the city will have no choice
but to surrender.

176
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,120
The riches of London
will be yours without exception.

177
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,330
The one whose sacrifices
ensured this favorable outcome

178
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,330
is none other than Prince Canute.

179
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,880
What is the logic of punishing the man
who accomplished this deed?

180
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,800
These commands may worry your generals

181
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,430
when it is time
to divide the new territory.

182
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,050
I beg you to reconsider.

183
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,190
You're a well-spoken man.

184
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,810
Askeladd.

185
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,820
"Of the ashes," huh?

186
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,110
That is only an epithet.

187
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,610
Tell me the name your father gave you.

188
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,540
It is only Askeladd.

189
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,160
My father did not give me a name.

190
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,630
A bastard from his mistress?

191
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,170
No.

192
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,880
You were born to a slave.

193
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,850
What?

194
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,150
I've never seen Askeladd so enraged.

195
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,690
Canute,

196
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,860
you have brought an astute retainer.

197
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
It's just as he said.

198
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,830
I should reward you and your men.

199
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
Tomorrow, I will depart for York.

200
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,920
There, a banquet will be prepared.

201
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,170
I will grant you your reward there.

202
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,480
I was scared to death, Your Highness.

203
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,740
What is there to be worried about?

204
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,240
As you rightly presumed,

205
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,160
the king has no good reason
to kill me now.

206
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,370
He wishes to be called a wise king.

207
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,750
As long as we aren't rash,
it's safer to stay close to him.

208
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,380
All the more reason to refrain
from provoking him as you did now.

209
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,800
That won't be a problem.

210
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,430
King Sweyn is a slave to his crown.

211
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,560
I will show him

212
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,230
how to master the will of the crown.

213
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,440
Askeladd?

214
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:20,160
I should be careful
and treat him with caution.

215
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,750
Drink up!

216
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:31,000
Come on, drink to your heart's content!
Prince Canute is indulging us!

217
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,260
Long live the prince!

218
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,510
That's his 57th drink!

219
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,140
What a beast!

220
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,980
Hey, man who's been
swigging one drink after another,

221
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,890
who are you?

222
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,350
I don't recall inviting a monk.

223
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm Willibald. Have you forgotten me?

224
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,280
Huh?

225
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:00,950
The bearded one?

226
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,700
-He's so young! How old are you?
-Twenty-three.

227
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,950
-No way!
-He's in his early twenties?

228
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,830
All right, I'll go against you next!

229
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,250
It's the commander's turn!

230
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,080
He's already had 58 drinks.

231
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,590
He's a strange man.

232
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:18,340
He does as he pleases
but is hated by no one.

233
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,260
Yes.

234
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,220
So, how goes it?

235
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,770
Do you think you can

236
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,680
kill the king?

237
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,190
It will certainly

238
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,230
pose significant challenges.

239
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,570
By the look of him, he is smart.

240
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,360
He possesses insight
and the will to make the first move.

241
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,790
If he sees us contravening his authority,
he will make his next move.

242
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,870
I would say he's skilled in battle.

243
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,630
I suppose that is why
he is the king of the land.

244
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,840
He is a formidable foe.

245
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,800
Even if we could kill him,
we cannot do it now.

246
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,100
In the meantime,
while we consider his vulnerabilities,

247
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,390
we must play the part of loyal subjects.

248
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,520
Your Highness!

249
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,070
I am overjoyed at your safe return.

250
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,610
You cannot imagine
how worried Gunnar has been!

251
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,910
Forgive me for not receiving you
upon your return to the castle.

252
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,580
After all, I myself just returned
from a foreign land.

253
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,660
Of course, I always knew
you'd return home safely.

254
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,630
What's this?
Is this gentleman your new retainer?

255
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,710
May I be introduced to him?

256
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,670
This is Ragnar's younger brother Gunnar.
Introduce yourself.

257
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,510
I am the son of Olaf, Askeladd.

258
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,390
Oh my, you seem very reliable.

259
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,850
I am Gunnar.

260
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,020
By the way, Your Highness,

261
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,860
regarding our old plan
it seems our prospects have improved.

262
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,980
The Duchy of Normandy.

263
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,450
I'd like to speak with you
and my brother about it later.

264
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,910
Ragnar has died.

265
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,030
I'm sorry for the trouble
you must have taken.

266
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,040
Also, I will not go into exile.

267
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
Your Highness…

268
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,750
I know that traveling
to all those countries was difficult.

269
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:21,710
I just had
a confrontation with King Sweyn.

270
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,340
-I'd like you to lend a hand.
-Ragnar is…

271
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,300
Gunnar.

272
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,470
Your job is to watch the king
and report back to me.

273
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,520
Choose useful men whom you can trust.

274
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,900
Your Highness! You mustn't speak
of that in a place like this.

275
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
Don't worry.

276
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,020
This place is the perfect cover.

277
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,650
Your Highness.

278
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,030
You have changed.

279
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
I have.

280
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,040
And I must change everything else.

281
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,930
That Gunnar could be a problem.

282
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,220
I don't think he's as loyal to the prince
as he let's on.

283
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,030
You're certainly devoted
to your preparation.

284
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,570
Your right arm is healing well.

285
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
Askeladd.

286
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,330
I see.

287
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,170
You're going back home?

288
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,300
I know you said you don't care,
but we're still traitors to you.

289
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,510
I don't know
how we could ever face you again.

290
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,430
That hurt!

291
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,390
That's right! I got you!

292
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,720
And now that my brother is like this…

293
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:59,140
I hope Bjorn's injuries heal.

294
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,190
Atli, how can you call yourself a Viking
after saying all that?

295
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,530
How did an honest man like you
ever become my lackey?

296
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,620
Bjorn won't last much longer.

297
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,330
The wound spread to his bowels.

298
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,170
Soon, Thorfinn will be
the last man from the old crew.

299
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,090
It's the perfect time for a fresh start.

300
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,050
Your bracelet?

301
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,180
It's gold. Take it.

302
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,180
What? I can't! I have no reason to!

303
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,060
Just accept it.

304
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,980
You can never have
too much gold on your travels.

305
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,350
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,900
Then, with grate gratitude…

307
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,900
Huh? What?

308
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,230
What the hell?

309
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,650
Are you giving it to me or not?

310
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,860
I have a condition.

311
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,450
Never wield a sword again.

312
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,790
It doesn't suit you, Atli.

313
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,420
Buy some sheep, take a wife,
raise kids, and die in your bed.

314
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,670
If I ever see you on a battlefield again,
I'll kill you, even if you're my friend.

315
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,050
Yes.

316
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:13,890
I understand.

317
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,270
What is that?

318
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,610
What is it?

319
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,440
It's something precious.

320
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,620
That's a high price! Lower it!

321
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,920
-Bring out a younger woman!
-A younger woman!

322
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,460
Anyone want her? She's a fine beauty!

323
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
