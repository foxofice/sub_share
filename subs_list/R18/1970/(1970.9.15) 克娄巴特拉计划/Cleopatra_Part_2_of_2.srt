1
00:00:00,595 --> 00:00:01,619
Who is he?

2
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:03,745
He looks very strong.

3
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:08,703
Caesar looks too calm.  He must
be up to something.

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:09,642
Huh?

5
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:12,678
And over in this corner,

6
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:19,186
Twelve-time coliseum champion,
weighing in at 581lbs:

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,885
The big blue bastard!

8
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,031
Kill him quickly.

9
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:29,683
There are three rounds
for this competition.

10
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:32,476
Competitors my use any
weapon at any time.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,581
Lets get ready to rumble!

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,441
That's the end of the first round.

13
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,094
His hand!

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,127
Attack his right hand!

15
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,541
Heads or tails?

16
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:49,666
That's the end of the second round.

17
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,465
Enough playing around.
Use this sword.

18
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,187
Somebody help that man!

19
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,452
Yaonius!

20
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:10,838
Caesar! Caesar!

21
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,836
Well done, Yaonius.

22
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:15,285
Caesar, give it to me.

23
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,567
Oh, I'll give it to you all right.

24
00:03:21,558 --> 00:03:25,927
Long live Caesar!

25
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:36,275
Long live Caesar, champion of Rome,
Destined to go down in history!

26
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,419
His illness is back.

27
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:52,014
Be quiet!  Be quiet!

28
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,419
He has been asleep since
the incident.

29
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,025
He's tired.

30
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,636
He'll be good as new
after a good rest

31
00:04:08,038 --> 00:04:09,676
This is all that Egyptian
woman's fault.

32
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,431
Father has nothing in
common with Cleopatra.

33
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,643
That woman is a savage.

34
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:16,756
Just let him rest for now, Octavius.

35
00:04:25,622 --> 00:04:28,523
Mommy, I won...

36
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:50,924
Go ahead and sleep.
I can do all the work myself.

37
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:55,504
Cleopatra.

38
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:56,228
Yes.

39
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:57,945
What do you think
you are doing here?

40
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,449
Give me back my husband.

41
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:00,914
Your husband?

42
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:03,028
You are mistaken.

43
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:03,874
The father of my child.

44
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:04,810
I think not.

45
00:05:04,995 --> 00:05:06,394
Leave Caesar or I will kill you.

46
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:07,613
Get out.

47
00:05:08,365 --> 00:05:09,730
This man belongs to me.

48
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,969
Then Caesar will be
mine after I kill you.

49
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:15,063
Do you know Apollo Duolia?

50
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:17,384
She planned for me to kill Caesar,

51
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:19,513
but I changed my mind.

52
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,479
I will let you live if you leave now
and never return.

53
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:24,125
No!

54
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,027
I will kill you.

55
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,715
Caesar doesn't love you any more.

56
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,870
Lying whore!

57
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:44,476
Wake him and we'll see
who he really loves.

58
00:05:44,634 --> 00:05:46,374
That's impossible.

59
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:48,339
Why don't you get naked
and give it a try?

60
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,205
Caesar

61
00:05:59,282 --> 00:05:59,862
Eh?

62
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:04,771
It is your wife.

63
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:06,369
Mommy?

64
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:08,613
Are you my mommy?

65
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,352
I am Cleopatra.

66
00:06:12,896 --> 00:06:13,783
Oh, it's you.

67
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:16,525
Where is my mommy?

68
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:18,998
Wouldn't you like to come with me?

69
00:06:20,036 --> 00:06:20,650
Mommy!

70
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,034
Yes, my son?

71
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,330
I had a nightmare.

72
00:06:27,944 --> 00:06:28,729
I dreamt I died.

73
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,574
Silly boy.

74
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:33,015
Mother will protect you.

75
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,698
Sleep now my beautiful child.

76
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm afraid to sleep alone!

77
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:42,201
OK, OK, you can sleep with mother.

78
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,639
Do you understand?  This is Caesar.

79
00:06:46,963 --> 00:06:50,137
The man regresses to a child-like
state whenever he comes to Rome.

80
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:55,130
You are just a conquered whore
who wants to trade sex for power.

81
00:06:56,006 --> 00:07:01,126
No man could ever love a greedy whore
like you.  Not as a man loves a wife.

82
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,188
Go back to Egypt, Cleopatra.

83
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:13,985
That man does not love me.
That man has never loved me!

84
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,537
Caesar is everywhere.

85
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,687
The people of Rome are
inundated by his image.

86
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:50,589
He claims to be a god.

87
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,339
It is an eye-sore.

88
00:07:52,903 --> 00:07:54,242
Or more like a public health hazard.

89
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,505
This trend must be stopped.

90
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:58,581
Brutus

91
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:01,890
The senate chairman has been
bought out by Caesar.

92
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,736
Now he can pass any law.

93
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:05,525
That is not all.

94
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:09,861
Antonius, Octavius,
Lumanicus, Levicus.

95
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,020
How can Caesar pay off
so many senators?

96
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:15,260
Julius Caesar

97
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:19,323
I propose we build a temple
devoted to Caesar.

98
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,841
The people need a place
to worship me.

99
00:08:22,358 --> 00:08:28,911
All those in favor of the proposal
to build a temple of Caesar,
please stand up.

100
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,216
All those opposed, state your
opposition.

101
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:32,683
I have something to say.

102
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:34,533
Cicero.

103
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,712
This senate is a farce.

104
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:42,908
Half of the senators do not
bother to show up.
The other half are corrupt.

105
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:43,404
Chairman,

106
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,257
I have a response.

107
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:45,912
Caesar.

108
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:52,533
Cicero is not in possession of
all of the pertinent details.
The senate is functioning perfectly.

109
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:57,379
That sounds reasonable.
Cicero's comments are stricken
from the record.

110
00:08:57,594 --> 00:08:59,471
Caesar's proposal passes.

111
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:04,289
The temple will be built immediately.
This session is closed.

112
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,052
Oh shit!

113
00:09:10,974 --> 00:09:13,363
Caesar or one of his cronies
steals every vote.

114
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,934
Something must be done.

115
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:16,509
Don't worry about Caesar.

116
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:19,148
I will pay him a visit.

117
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:20,403
Right now.

118
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:22,041
Brutus

119
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:25,426
Oh, it's Cleopatra's creepy
old lady friend.

120
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:28,589
Cleopatra would like to
speak to you.

121
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:31,726
Please kill him.

122
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:34,967
Isn't that a bit harsh?

123
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,075
I can't do something like that.

124
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:39,417
He wants absolute power over Rome.

125
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:43,248
Rome is a democracy.  Caesar must
not be allowed to seize power.

126
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,158
That isn't possible.

127
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:45,806
You can't just go around killing people.

128
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,306
He must die.

129
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,649
Just because he dumped you
does not mean he deserves to die.

130
00:09:52,382 --> 00:09:53,030
What's that?

131
00:09:53,349 --> 00:09:57,445
Think of this as a political donation
from Cleopatra to Brutus.

132
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,336
A bribe?  Don't be ridiculous.

133
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,843
I will keep piling on bags of gold
until you say stop.

134
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:04,859
You're being serious?

135
00:10:05,028 --> 00:10:06,365
It is for the common good.

136
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:08,218
Don't joke like that.

137
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,285
This is no joke.

138
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:10,887
How will I spend all that?

139
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,225
That's up to you.

140
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:42,007
Et tu, BrutÃ©?

141
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:55,078
Caesar!

142
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,111
Caesar!

143
00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,502
Caesar is dead!

144
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,111
Caesar died!  Caesar was killed!

145
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:09,032
Bring Yaonius here.

146
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:10,900
We must leave Rome quickly.

147
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:14,223
Rome without him is pointless.

148
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:25,937
Yaonius?

149
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,497
Yes?

150
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,137
Are you happy to be
going back to Egypt?

151
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:33,359
Libia is waiting for you.

152
00:14:35,731 --> 00:14:39,895
But who is waiting for me?

153
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:46,453
Yaonius!

154
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:47,950
Libia!

155
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:51,454
Libia!

156
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:12,110
Mark Antony is coming from
Rome to see you.

157
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:14,847
Has it been a whole year already?

158
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:17,622
It is said he is already
entranced by your beauty.

159
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,695
Just like Caesar.

160
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:20,722
Exactly.

161
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:25,661
Mark Antony is just like Caesar.

162
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:27,614
He will be easy to control.

163
00:16:35,351 --> 00:16:39,071
This meeting with Cleopatra
must go well.

164
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:42,884
Are you feeling OK Mark Antony?

165
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,787
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

166
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:48,106
Then why are you so nervous?

167
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:51,681
You would not understand, Kaba.

168
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:52,922
It's Kabanius.

169
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:54,698
Yes, yes, I always forget the "nius".

170
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:56,098
You used to just be "Kaba"

171
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:59,579
The saying goes "To get a Tiger,
grab its ass"

172
00:17:00,142 --> 00:17:02,770
Or "To get a tiger cub,
fuck a tigress".

173
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:03,902
Either one works.

174
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:08,816
I'm sure Cleopatra will enjoy
your crude jokes.

175
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,247
She will, Kaba.

176
00:17:10,386 --> 00:17:11,375
Kabanius.

177
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:12,679
I know, I know.

178
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,161
What does any of this have
to do with war?

179
00:17:15,491 --> 00:17:16,890
I don't know.

180
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,998
What about Egypt?

181
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:22,056
What if Cleopatra asks for advice
about running the country?

182
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,713
You will have to help me.

183
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,188
I understand.

184
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:34,028
I will speak to her myself.

185
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,996
What am I going to do?

186
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:42,739
I'm scared.

187
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:46,110
Man up and do what you must.

188
00:17:47,123 --> 00:17:47,908
You're not helping.

189
00:17:48,524 --> 00:17:53,917
It..it..it is I, Mark Antony,
come to speak with Cleopatra.

190
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:01,129
Welcome.

191
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,010
I have missed you, Mark Antony.

192
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:07,229
I haven't seen you
since I left Rome.

193
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,025
I am so happy.

194
00:18:09,858 --> 00:18:13,066
Oh, you've gone all stiff and hard.

195
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:16,834
I believe a man should be
stiff and hard.

196
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:21,012
I'm glad you think so.  It takes
a stiff man to satisfy me.

197
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:29,326
Here, let's drink a toast to
our happy reunion.

198
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:33,732
When I see a beautiful woman,
um, not that I look at a lot of them...

199
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,559
No, what I meant to say is...

200
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:37,352
Hold on.

201
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,947
What was I trying to say?

202
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,831
A beautiful woman.

203
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:44,911
Yes, when I see a beautiful woman,

204
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,714
I get confused.

205
00:18:46,949 --> 00:18:49,747
Nonsense.  You speak like
a poet.

206
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:57,445
Ah, good wine.

207
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:02,557
This wine is called
"A delightful kiss"

208
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:04,788
Delightful kiss?

209
00:19:05,367 --> 00:19:07,824
Yes, just like this.

210
00:19:12,475 --> 00:19:13,191
Was that delightful?

211
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:14,555
Yes.

212
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:16,293
Would you like more?

213
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:17,227
Yes.

214
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,155
You stopped.

215
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:43,218
Why?

216
00:19:43,572 --> 00:19:44,630
This ring,

217
00:19:44,774 --> 00:19:46,685
This is Caesar's ring.

218
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,312
Yes, he left it to me.

219
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:53,900
When I wear this ring, I am
Caesar's official deputy.
I carry on his legacy.

220
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,129
Did you love Caesar?

221
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:58,242
I respect his memory.

222
00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:00,476
And now I will pass
it on to you.

223
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:02,985
Hey, what the fuck?

224
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:05,102
Forget the dead.
The past is the past.

225
00:20:06,028 --> 00:20:09,304
All that matters now
is the two of us.

226
00:20:20,976 --> 00:20:21,761
What's wrong?

227
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,561
I can't do this.

228
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:26,141
Why not?

229
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,484
I cannot satisfy you
like he did.

230
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:33,484
I have a small dick.

231
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,616
It's pathetic compared to Caesar's.

232
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:39,753
Oh don't be ridiculous.

233
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,974
That doesn't matter.

234
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,994
Let me show you.

235
00:20:47,102 --> 00:20:50,549
Say "Ahhh"

236
00:20:56,846 --> 00:20:57,631
What do you taste?

237
00:20:58,113 --> 00:20:59,375
I don't know.  I swallowed it.

238
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:00,842
Now, try this one.

239
00:21:01,383 --> 00:21:03,260
Say "Ahhh"

240
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,872
Did you taste that one?

241
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:13,295
You see Mark Antony,
size is not important.

242
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:17,676
Cleopatra

243
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,136
Get ready for a hard dicking.

244
00:21:21,837 --> 00:21:23,031
Bombs away!

245
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:10,523
How did you like that?

246
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,229
Oh, you're the best
I've ever had.

247
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:21,933
You are being manipulated
by Cleopatra.

248
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:24,275
She will ruin you.

249
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:26,183
No, Kaba.

250
00:22:26,835 --> 00:22:27,654
Kabanius

251
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:28,924
That's what I said.

252
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:31,378
Cleopatra is good.

253
00:22:31,974 --> 00:22:33,100
No, she's great.

254
00:22:33,876 --> 00:22:37,016
I would gladly lay down my
life for that woman.

255
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:38,608
You're a mess.

256
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:44,360
You have 200 thousand troops
under your command.

257
00:22:44,954 --> 00:22:46,865
If you conquer Egypt,

258
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:49,506
you can conquer the world.

259
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:50,510
The world.

260
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,136
There may be some
truth to that.

261
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,734
Yes.  You must leave Cleopatra.

262
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:01,363
Go east.

263
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:02,683
I will.

264
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,642
To conquer the world for Cleopatra!

265
00:23:37,773 --> 00:23:39,752
Prepare Mark Antony's bed.

266
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:40,549
Yes sir.

267
00:24:02,131 --> 00:24:02,984
You look like hell.

268
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,178
You would have conquered the world
by now if that woman hadn't
turned you into such a pansy.

269
00:24:12,841 --> 00:24:15,196
Why are you babbling
like a retard?

270
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,039
Get rid of Cleopatra.

271
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,785
Thank you for your hospitality.

272
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:40,235
I think the king has
something to say.

273
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:41,729
What's on your mind, Siluodiao?

274
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:44,585
Leave us.

275
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,988
Kill Cleopatra.

276
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,570
Listen to me.

277
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:01,960
Cleopatra killed Caesar.

278
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:05,387
She will kill you next
unless you kill her first.

279
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,893
That's crazy.
Stop joking around.

280
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,189
Listen to me.

281
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:16,156
Cleopatra brought nothing
but bad luck to Rome.

282
00:25:16,538 --> 00:25:20,668
I don't know what
you're talking about.

283
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:23,732
This is ridiculous.

284
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:25,034
Kill Cleopatra.

285
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,614
Either she dies,

286
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:29,315
or you will die.

287
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:30,435
I don't believe it.

288
00:25:31,053 --> 00:25:33,203
I can't believe it.

289
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:34,514
Kill Cleopatra!

290
00:25:35,124 --> 00:25:35,636
Kill her!

291
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,451
What happened Mark Antony?

292
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:43,008
No..nothing.

293
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:45,165
I'm just a bit tired.

294
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:46,111
Report!

295
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:49,299
Octavius has taken control of
Rome with 130 thousand soldiers.

296
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:52,033
They are fighting your supporters.

297
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,512
Transfer all my troops from
Alexandria back to Rome

298
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,058
All my warships too.

299
00:26:33,348 --> 00:26:35,122
Understand?

300
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:40,805
Mark Antony will be victorious!

301
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:42,744
One more bottle.

302
00:26:54,102 --> 00:26:56,593
The perfect poison.

303
00:26:57,005 --> 00:27:01,920
It should take effect in
the midst of battle.

304
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,425
We must take the fight
out of the soldiers.

305
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:18,595
OK ladies, you know what to do.
Fuck them till they
can't even stand up.

306
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:24,625
Sweet.

307
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,617
What are you doing, Kaba?

308
00:28:40,609 --> 00:28:43,237
Where the hell is everybody?

309
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,654
Yaonius should be here.

310
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:49,632
He's a special case.

311
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:51,551
I can count on him.

312
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:53,334
Definitely.

313
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:59,289
I had no idea your girls
would be so effective,

314
00:28:59,328 --> 00:28:59,908
Libia.

315
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:01,217
Sex is a weapon.

316
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:02,443
It sure is.

317
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,154
Mark Antony was totally fooled.

318
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,407
We'll kill the general first,
then the soldiers.

319
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:08,958
This will be the end of Mark Antony.

320
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:11,489
Say it again.

321
00:29:11,973 --> 00:29:13,270
Call me an idiot.

322
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:15,433
Come on, say it to my face!

323
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:16,793
Bastard.

324
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,658
Who put you up to this?

325
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,219
Was it Cleopatra?

326
00:29:23,485 --> 00:29:24,611
Was it Cleopatra?

327
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,589
I see the answer in your face.

328
00:29:27,456 --> 00:29:29,913
I should have known that
bitch was up to something.

329
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,538
OK, now I am pissed.

330
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:35,482
I am going to kill Cleopatra.

331
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:40,592
And I will kill every last traitor
involved in this plan.

332
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:42,096
Starting with you.

333
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,319
It can't end like this.

334
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:01,914
I have failed.

335
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:03,785
I really mean it this time.

336
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:08,387
It is quite hard to
pick a winner this time.

337
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,444
Rock, paper, scissors.

338
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:03,332
I win!

339
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:12,181
Load up the crossbows!

340
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,025
Hoist the sails!

341
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:15,471
Listen to me.

342
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:17,796
Full speed ahead,
We can take them.

343
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:43,650
Their boat looks much
bigger up close.

344
00:32:52,294 --> 00:32:55,879
Oh god, is this really the end?

345
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:44,829
Congratulations.

346
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,628
I heard that Mark Antony has
been totally defeated.

347
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:51,706
He will be killed and his
corpse thrown into the sea.

348
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:53,586
Haha

349
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:55,200
No.

350
00:33:59,394 --> 00:34:01,203
I know all about Mark Antony.

351
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,838
Why?  What business
is it of yours?

352
00:34:07,636 --> 00:34:09,479
He hates me.

353
00:34:10,472 --> 00:34:12,451
Because he trusted me.

354
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:13,321
My queen,

355
00:34:14,376 --> 00:34:15,809
What is wrong with you?

356
00:34:21,383 --> 00:34:23,294
Mark Antony has returned!

357
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:25,991
Cleopatra!

358
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:28,177
He has a sword.

359
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:30,062
Your highness, you are in danger!

360
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,568
My queen.

361
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,788
I am here, Mark Antony.

362
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:49,656
Cleopatra, where are you?

363
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,971
Mark Antony

364
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,282
I recognize your scent.

365
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:02,514
I wanted to come
back, now I am back.

366
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:03,871
It was worth it.

367
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:08,351
I am so tired.
Please ki..ki..

368
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:09,989
Kiss you?

369
00:35:10,198 --> 00:35:14,601
Yes, I need you
to kiss me.

370
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:28,551
Thank you, for a
sweet last kiss.

371
00:35:33,822 --> 00:35:35,699
Mark Antony, don't die!

372
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,741
Mark Antony!

373
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:33,396
No. No.

374
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:49,743
First Caesar was killed,
then Mark Antony was killed too.

375
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,583
Now it is Octavius.

376
00:36:56,137 --> 00:36:58,253
When will it all end?

377
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:01,216
It will never end, Cleopatra.

378
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:08,891
As long as Egypt is under
attack, it can never end.

379
00:37:09,517 --> 00:37:12,520
It's too much, too much.

380
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:15,856
Apollo Duolia, change me
back to the way I was!

381
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:18,164
Do you even remember
your life before?

382
00:37:18,326 --> 00:37:22,934
I was plain and normal,
with a simple life.
I want that life again.

383
00:37:22,997 --> 00:37:23,440
What do you want?

384
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:24,585
My original face.

385
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:25,212
What else?

386
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:26,279
Love.

387
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:27,013
Meaningless.

388
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,523
I want to be an ordinary
woman again.

389
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,773
So I can have the the things
that ordinary women get to have.

390
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:33,796
Will you reconsider?

391
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,236
No, I have made up my mind.

392
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:38,207
Do you not care for
the fate of Egypt?

393
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:41,982
How can you be so weak,
Queen Cleopatra?

394
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:44,390
Don't ignore me!

395
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:04,278
Where do you want to go?

396
00:38:04,772 --> 00:38:07,400
Anywhere I can be free
and lead a normal life.

397
00:38:08,343 --> 00:38:10,220
There is no more
freedom in Egypt.

398
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,848
Cleopatra has disappeared.

399
00:38:20,237 --> 00:38:21,385
Yes, I'm sorry.

400
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:26,117
You will find her or
you will die.

401
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:28,650
Don't worry, I will
find her.

402
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:45,767
I can't hear you over the wind.
We'll have to talk in
speech bubbles.

403
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:49,829
We need to get out of this sand storm.

404
00:38:50,251 --> 00:38:53,596
I think I see something ahead.

405
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:57,725
Is is a giant rock?

406
00:39:04,832 --> 00:39:06,026
What is that?

407
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,956
It has the body of a lion
and the head of a man.

408
00:39:13,207 --> 00:39:14,913
This is the tomb of a king.

409
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:32,307
It's automated.

410
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:37,625
The entrance to a temple.

411
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:40,181
Anybody home?

412
00:39:47,075 --> 00:39:48,769
Wait, there are instructions.

413
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:51,794
"Welcome to OOKAI tomb"

414
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,005
Whoever wishes to enter,

415
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,734
Must first relinquish their
mortal coil, or in other
words, die.

416
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,196
There are many varied and
interesting ways to die here.

417
00:40:02,357 --> 00:40:04,302
For details, see the
instruction manual.

418
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:08,508
In the 1st room, you will be
crushed by falling stones.

419
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:11,905
In the 2nd room, you
will be buried alive.

420
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,196
Room three contains
poisonous snakes.

421
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:17,532
Room four...

422
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:18,593
Enough, Yaonius.

423
00:40:19,941 --> 00:40:22,944
We are not safe here.
This is some sort of temple of death.

424
00:40:23,745 --> 00:40:24,461
Let's go.

425
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:40,359
It won't budge.

426
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:41,849
I think it opens from
the outside only.

427
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:42,401
Oh.

428
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:44,461
We can't open it from here.

429
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,381
You cannot enter here.

430
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:06,004
Cleopatra must be inside.

431
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:08,140
You are protecting her.

432
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,566
This is the tomb of a king.

433
00:41:11,025 --> 00:41:13,311
You can't go in.

434
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:14,437
Move.

435
00:41:14,996 --> 00:41:18,545
Please.  Wait out here.
I will go inside and look.

436
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,189
I will bring Cleopatra out.

437
00:41:21,402 --> 00:41:23,142
Please just wait out here.

438
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,018
Cleopatra

439
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,536
You have come at last.

440
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:50,814
Yes

441
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,490
What is it you want from Egypt?

442
00:41:55,603 --> 00:41:57,412
I want you, to begin with.

443
00:41:57,972 --> 00:42:02,784
I am a Queen with no power,
but you are a hero.

444
00:42:04,212 --> 00:42:06,191
I think it will be different
this time around.

445
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:10,464
You look so beautiful.

446
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:11,812
Only for you.

447
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:14,709
Octavius,

448
00:42:16,424 --> 00:42:20,758
Ever since we met back
in Rome,

449
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:23,601
You have left an impression
on my heart.

450
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:26,720
So you've missed me?

451
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:27,844
Yes

452
00:42:28,836 --> 00:42:31,498
I will bring you back to Rome.

453
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,656
Really?

454
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:40,719
I will take you back as a captive.
You can watch me rebuild Rome
from inside a cage.

455
00:42:42,049 --> 00:42:46,554
I am nothing like Caesar or Mark
Antony.  You are useless to me.

456
00:42:47,188 --> 00:42:51,761
But I will take you back with
me anyway, as a trophy.

457
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,949
You shouldn't joke like that.

458
00:42:55,129 --> 00:43:04,822
I am still young.  I can love you
like no other. I can make you
the greatest king in the world.

459
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:11,453
Compare the world to Rome.
Think about it, Octavius.

460
00:43:12,046 --> 00:43:14,196
My Queen, I've come for you.

461
00:43:18,986 --> 00:43:20,965
Your warrior.

462
00:43:21,389 --> 00:43:22,105
Yaonius.

463
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:26,675
Oh!  I have heard about
you!  Nice to meet you!

464
00:43:26,928 --> 00:43:28,907
Just look at this body.

465
00:43:35,002 --> 00:43:37,186
I heard all about you back in Rome.
Imagine meeting you way out here.

466
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:38,570
I lose sleep thinking of you.

467
00:43:38,706 --> 00:43:42,290
It's true.  Sometimes
I can't fall asleep.

468
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:46,264
I am so happy, and
you are so gorgeous.

469
00:43:46,514 --> 00:43:50,746
You must come live with me,
OK, my darling?

470
00:43:52,053 --> 00:43:52,872
Octavius?

471
00:43:55,256 --> 00:44:00,376
I will go back with you if
you will wait for five minutes.

472
00:44:01,362 --> 00:44:03,136
OK, five minutes.

473
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:04,141
My Queen.

474
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:05,440
Libia?

475
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:06,274
Yes?

476
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:09,041
Bring me to the third room.

477
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,289
But your highness,

478
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:12,403
that room...

479
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,473
You mustn't go there!

480
00:44:14,675 --> 00:44:15,152
Why not?

481
00:44:15,977 --> 00:44:19,868
I do this as my final act
as queen of Egypt.

482
00:45:04,759 --> 00:45:07,489
Thank you for all
you have done for me.

483
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:08,512
Cleopatra

484
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,644
My Queen.

485
00:45:10,698 --> 00:45:11,175
Libia?

486
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:12,073
Yes?

487
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:15,672
You said there was no
freedom left in Egypt.

488
00:45:17,438 --> 00:45:17,984
But there is.

489
00:45:19,173 --> 00:45:23,030
I have found it in your
loving heart.

490
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:33,237
Mark Antony, come
take me away.

491
00:45:36,557 --> 00:45:45,261
I will be with Mark Antony
in the afterlife.

492
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:51,260
So don't cry for me, Libia.

493
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:57,656
Mark Antony, I am ready.

494
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,350
Mark Antony...

495
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,845
You highness!
Your highness!

496
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:30,093
Look Libia, an air shaft.  Maybe
we can escape through there.

497
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:43,170
Luck is with us.

498
00:46:44,091 --> 00:46:45,896
Libia, it is time to go.

499
00:47:09,116 --> 00:47:37,890
Roman troops, get out!

500
00:47:53,127 --> 00:47:56,164
Thank you.  Is there anything
else you would like to add?

501
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:57,653
