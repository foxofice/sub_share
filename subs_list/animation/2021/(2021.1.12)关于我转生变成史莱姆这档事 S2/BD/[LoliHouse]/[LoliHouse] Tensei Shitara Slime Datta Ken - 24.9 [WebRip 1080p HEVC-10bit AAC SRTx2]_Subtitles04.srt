1
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:07,219
This world...

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,188
...is filled with despair.

3
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:16,859
I want you to rely on me whenever
you lose your way.

4
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,429
Ms.Shizu...

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,289
Chief Knight of the Holy
Emperor's Imperial Guard,

6
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:27,797
Captain of the Crusaders, Hinata Sakaguchi.

7
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:29,265
What is it?

8
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,313
You've received a letter from
an eastern merchant.

9
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,711
Very well.

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,328
The kingdom of monsters...

11
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,883
Jura Tempest Federation...

12
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,159
Near the central east of the continent,
(Jura Tempest Federation)

13
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:48,305
there is the Great Forest of Jura.

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:56,226
There reside various race of monsters
such as Goblin, Ogre, Orc, and Lizardmen.

15
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:58,758
Together, they created
this new country.

16
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,980
The kingdom of monsters; Tempest.

17
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:07,039
They boast a town that
is clean and comfortable to live in.

18
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:13,328
The residents are given proper
education to write and calculate.

19
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,952
They also produce stuff
such as weapon, armor,

20
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,296
and silk goods with
their high technological skill.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,414
(Armed Nation of Dwargon)

22
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:26,711
The Dwarf Kingdom ruled by Gazel Dwargo;
Armed Nation of Dwargon,

23
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,078
and the Human Kingdom,
(Kingdom of Blumund)

24
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:33,070
Blumund has formed a
friendly relations with them.

25
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:38,828
They also participates in trades
and steadily grow their economical standing.

26
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:42,141
Their influence continues to
grow bigger.

27
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:48,703
The leader of the kingdom of monsters
Jura Tempest Federation...

28
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,203
His name is...

29
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,891
Rimuru Tempest.

30
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,305
Rimuru...

31
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:16,735
In the night you could
count stars in the sky

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,392
The overflown drop
reflects the swaying world

33
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:28,190
All life are in ambivalence

34
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,527
And it twinkles as the days goes by

35
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:39,670
Both short-lived flowers
and devastating winds

36
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:43,878
are the sign of the passing present

37
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:50,671
To those who live in the moment,
this song shall reach you

38
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,967
It will push you to the limits of freedom,

39
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,659
telling you to survive

40
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:01,549
We will find the way

41
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:09,595
We returners all equally
carry a seed of hope

42
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:17,239
Under the whim of miracle,
Birth and Demise shall join hand

43
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,284
and the time will flow once again

44
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:30,962
(That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime)

45
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,484
My name is Rimuru Tempest.
(Extra Episode: Hinata Sakaguchi)

46
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,484
As you can see, I'm a Slime.
(Extra Episode: Hinata Sakaguchi)

47
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,086
However, I used to be a human.

48
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:46,594
Sure is peaceful...

49
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:49,438
This is how I looked back then.

50
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:52,484
Mikami Satoru, 37 years old, virg-

51
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:54,812
-cough, cough.

52
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm actually quite a nice looking man,
if I say so myself.

53
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:00,750
I believe.

54
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:03,383
You think so, too, right? Right?

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,157
I used to be a pretty skilled salaryman
working under a big general contractor firm.

56
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:11,689
But...

57
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:20,157
Tamura!

58
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:40,009
Senpai!

59
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,961
I got stabbed by some random criminal...

60
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:47,883
...and die.

61
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:53,133
And then...

62
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:59,312
I somehow got reincarnated as a slime
in another world, basically.

63
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:09,211
I am the Storm Dragon, Veldora.

64
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:10,641
Storm Dragon?

65
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:15,180
I am one of only four True Dragons
that exist in this world.

66
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:26,407
I first become friends with Veldora.

67
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,328
Please grant us your protection!

68
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:35,266
If you do, we will swear our loyalty to you!

69
00:05:35,477 --> 00:05:36,914
We will swear!

70
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:41,326
In lieu of the Storm Dragon Veldora,

71
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,188
I, Rimuru Tempest, will grant your wish!

72
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:48,336
Then after all kind of things, I end up
protecting the Goblins.

73
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:51,805
Our pack yields to you.

74
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,961
To add, I became the leader
of the Direwolves.

75
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,383
Please accept our allegiance.

76
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,737
We will continue to serve you.

77
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,602
You're sure?

78
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:07,914
I have no objections.

79
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:11,782
We are truly fortunate to have met you.

80
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,179
I'm your secretary and
bodyguard, Great Rimuru!

81
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,484
I'll never leave your side!

82
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,016
Not until the ends of our lives.

83
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:24,133
O-Okay...

84
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,196
More and more things add in,
from Ogre and Orc,

85
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:33,055
and other races start to look
upon me as their new master.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,562
Then our nation shall be called
the Jura Tempest Federation,

87
00:06:37,587 --> 00:06:40,477
and this town shall be called Rimuru!

88
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:41,486
Huh?!

89
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:43,641
Central City of Rimuru!

90
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:45,695
Hang on, that's kinda embaressi―

91
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,132
Central City of Rimuru!

92
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,882
No other name would do!

93
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:52,344
I agree. It's a perfect name for our town.

94
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:57,234
Now that I've become their leader,
I've made up my mind.

95
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,742
I'll protect my friends and make Tempest
a great, comfortable, and safe city.

96
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,711
But, in addition to that...

97
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:10,547
I somehow ended up
becoming a teacher.

98
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,368
This is the Kingdom of Engrassia.
(Kingdom of Engrassia)

99
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:18,250
It's a very developed country in
the west continent.

100
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,938
It's also a very big and vibrant country.

101
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,766
Here stand the Adventurer aid organization;

102
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:32,547
Free Academy, formed by Free Guild as
training institution for its members.

103
00:07:33,188 --> 00:07:35,121
In there,

104
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,042
I fulfill the role of a teacher for
these children with special circumstances.

105
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,828
Because they are Shizu's lingering wish.

106
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:50,469
Shizu came to this world
from Japan, just like me.

107
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:01,797
I got here by reincarnation.

108
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:05,485
But Shizu is a Summon who
got summoned here.

109
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:20,539
By the Demon Lord, Leon Cromwell.

110
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:25,875
I thought she was useless, but she
may have an affinity for fire.

111
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:35,094
Ifrit, I offer her body to you.

112
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,696
Use it well.

113
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:56,758
A Summon, as the name suggest,
is a person who got summoned to this world.

114
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,547
A Summon?

115
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:00,868
Is that different
from Otherworlder?

116
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:05,352
It takes more than 30 mages to perform
a ritual that lasts several days.

117
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,290
to bring one here from another world.

118
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:10,782
They're also expected to
serve as powerful weapons.

119
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:11,883
Weapons?

120
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,547
Yes, for the Summoner.

121
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,703
Magic is used to carve a
curse into the Summon's soul

122
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:19,352
to ensure that the Summon
can't defy the Summoner.

123
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,555
Really? How outrageous!

124
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:24,188
Outrageous, huh?

125
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,946
I have no idea how was it
in your previous world,

126
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:30,961
but survival of the fittest is
the ultimate truth of this world.

127
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:32,883
I see...

128
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,602
Shizu continue to serve
the Demon Lord Leon.

129
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:41,282
Be it because of her curse,

130
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:44,688
or was it because of the fire spirit
Ifrit that harbored inside her,

131
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,250
not even Shizu herself know.

132
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:51,618
Then, few years later,

133
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:54,071
after a long fierce battle,

134
00:09:54,758 --> 00:09:58,305
the Demon Lord is said to have
abandoned his castle and escaped.

135
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:00,789
Leaving Shizu behind.

136
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:08,125
I can't win...!

137
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:15,164
Then the Hero take care of her.

138
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,289
The two travel the world together.

139
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,719
And after they part ways...

140
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:25,938
Shizu continue to travel around the world
as an Adventurer to save those in need.

141
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:30,282
Eventually, people start referring
to her as a "Champion."

142
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:35,024
However, as she gets older,
her magic start decaying,

143
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:38,336
and her control over Ifrit gets weaker.

144
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:42,727
So that she won't hurt others
when things gets bad,

145
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,969
she retire from her job as an Adventurer
and become a teacher at Free Academy.

146
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:54,508
Her students includes Yuuki Kagurazaha,
the Grandmaster of Free Guild.

147
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:58,563
But there is also one who left
her at one time.

148
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,586
And her last students...

149
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:02,758
That's right.

150
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:04,250
Kenya Misaki.

151
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,086
Ryota Sekiguchi.

152
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:08,188
Gail Gibson.

153
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,476
Alice Rondo.

154
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:12,664
And lastly, Chloe Aubert.

155
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,195
They're all Summons from my previous world.

156
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,516
What're we gonna do today, Sensei?

157
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:23,953
That's a good question.
What should we do today?

158
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,321
However...

159
00:11:26,414 --> 00:11:31,407
Shizu noticed that she only
have a short life left.

160
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,696
So she went to her last journey.

161
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,102
So, do you like our town?

162
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:44,226
Yes, very much.

163
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,211
You're welcome to stay
as long as you'd like, Shizu.

164
00:11:49,594 --> 00:11:50,875
Thank you...

165
00:11:51,313 --> 00:11:53,149
but I have to go.

166
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,610
You do?

167
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:58,594
If I stay here, I might
bring trouble for you.

168
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,625
The goal of my journey is...

169
00:12:04,883 --> 00:12:06,469
Goal?

170
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:10,821
...to find the man who summoned me.

171
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,368
What will you do when you find him?

172
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:21,055
To meet the Demon Lord
Leon Cromwell once again.

173
00:12:21,922 --> 00:12:25,305
However, she weren't able to.

174
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:33,032
Take this! Icicle Shotgun!

175
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:39,477
She couldn't suppress Ifrit anymore...

176
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,907
and then...

177
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:55,844
Hey, Mr.Slime, what's your name?

178
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,493
Huh? I told you, I'm Rimuru.

179
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,461
No, I mean your real name.

180
00:13:02,126 --> 00:13:02,926
Oh...

181
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,039
It's Satoru. Mikami Satoru.

182
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:12,250
I'm Shizue. Izawa Shizue.

183
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:19,532
Shizue, you should sleep now.

184
00:13:20,289 --> 00:13:24,102
Satoru, I'd like to ask a favor.

185
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:25,766
May I?

186
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:29,289
Of course. Ask me anything.

187
00:13:32,383 --> 00:13:33,633
Please...

188
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:36,132
eat me.

189
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:45,164
Just like you ate the curse
that had been cast on me.

190
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,196
That made me so happy.

191
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:54,774
I dislike this world...

192
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,984
Still, I can't abhor it.

193
00:14:00,368 --> 00:14:02,961
Just like that man...

194
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:06,539
So... That's why...

195
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:10,985
I don't want to be absorbed by this world.

196
00:14:12,914 --> 00:14:15,914
This is... my last request.

197
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:24,438
Would you... let me rest inside you?

198
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,524
Okay.

199
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:43,211
I swear to you on the name of
Mikami Satoru... no, Rimuru Tempest,

200
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:47,758
that I will make certain the Demon Lord
Leon Cromwell hears your wishes!

201
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:04,484
Shizu... my destined one...

202
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:07,805
Rest in peace within me.

203
00:15:08,188 --> 00:15:11,821
Use unique skill "Predator"?

204
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:14,508
Yes.

205
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,422
So that she can dream happy dreams forever
and never have to wake from them.

206
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,016
Will you be in the way of my plan?

207
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:40,231
The master of the Great Forest of Jura,
Rimuru Tempest.

208
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:46,532
Orc.

209
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:52,305
I thought of using those hungry
pigs as a part my army, but...

210
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:16,329
I've acknowledged you as an enemy.

211
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,516
Now, I'll take you on for real.

212
00:16:20,743 --> 00:16:22,157
Laughable!

213
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,008
Does that mean you weren't
serious before now?

214
00:16:25,454 --> 00:16:28,488
There is nothing more you can do!

215
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,533
Just accept that I'm going to eat you.

216
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:37,413
Before you can eat me,
I'm going to eat you.

217
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:41,321
I'm a slime.

218
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:43,305
Wha―

219
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:48,180
Wh-Why, you...

220
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,610
You're not the only one who can eat things!

221
00:16:53,454 --> 00:16:55,610
Will you eat me first...

222
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,727
or will I eat you first?

223
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,586
The one who completely
consumes the other wins!

224
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:29,602
I didn't expect that he would
be a hindrance to that.

225
00:17:34,508 --> 00:17:39,704
After that, I revived Charybdis
and have it goes to his place.

226
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,461
But the Demon Lord Milim
went to their side...

227
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:51,305
I've already seen that trick.

228
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:53,899
Now, I'll show you one of mine.

229
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:00,961
This is...

230
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:04,834
what you call "restraint"!

231
00:18:05,758 --> 00:18:09,213
Drago Buster!

232
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,154
Oh well...

233
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:25,678
We can just use Milim for
other thing later.

234
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,115
As for that slime called Rimuru...

235
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:35,904
Lets have his beloved friends disappear,
along with his entire country.

236
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:41,920
They're starting to be
a real nuisance, after all.

237
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,772
They dare to pick a fight with
I, Demon Lord Clayman, after all.

238
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:50,951
They should be prepared for what it cost.

239
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:04,404
Shizu's regret... it was five children
who got summoned to this world.

240
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:09,365
When a summoning is performed,
there are times when a child is summoned.

241
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:16,201
And when an amount of energy too vast
for that child's growing body is taken in...

242
00:19:16,654 --> 00:19:21,983
Eventually, that body will be incinerated
by all that energy with nowhere to go.

243
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,373
No one has found a way to
prevent their destruction.

244
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:29,904
Nearly all children under the age
of the who have been summoned

245
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,302
have died within five years.

246
00:19:33,264 --> 00:19:34,785
Please!

247
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,356
If it's at all possible,
please save those children!

248
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,373
I do what I can do.

249
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,902
That's how I act until now,
and will continue to do so from now on.

250
00:19:47,201 --> 00:19:49,053
I think hard.

251
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:53,176
Shizu was summoned when she was little.

252
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:54,537
But she survived.

253
00:19:54,694 --> 00:20:00,803
Perhaps it's thanks to Ifrit that she was
able to control the energy in her body.

254
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:05,858
And so, in an attempt to get spirits
to resides within the children,

255
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:08,165
we head out to the place
where the spirit lives.

256
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:11,092
All to capture high-rank spirits.

257
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:17,092
Then, we earn a help from
Ramiris, the Spirit Queen.

258
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,233
Right!

259
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:24,162
Kenya, Ryota, Gail, Alice, Chloe...

260
00:20:24,529 --> 00:20:25,404
Let's do this!

261
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,498
Yeah!

262
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:30,850
Shizu, are you seeing this?

263
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:34,811
I will fulfill your wish.

264
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,928
And then...

265
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,998
I was able to have spirits to reside
within the children

266
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:48,334
and successfully stabilize the
magicules in their body!

267
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,569
Well, I'm not really sure what
exactly that reside within Chloe, though.

268
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:59,842
But it went nicely, so no problem!
All well and good!

269
00:21:10,918 --> 00:21:12,402
I did it, Shizu.

270
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:14,785
It's all okay now.

271
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,902
And now, Shizu's last remaining
wish has been fulfilled.

272
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,074
All well, ends well.

273
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:27,309
That's what I thought.

274
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:30,613
However, little did I know.

275
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:35,238
That an outrageous disaster will
befall on my friends, Tempest,

276
00:21:35,263 --> 00:21:37,809
and of course, myself.

277
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:42,598
And it was all started by
Shizu's former student...

278
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,639
Hinata Sakaguchi.

279
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:55,176
Rimuru Tempest, huh...

280
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,983
So he's the one...

281
00:22:00,676 --> 00:22:01,904
I see...

282
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:04,957
It was you...

283
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:09,119
The one who killed her.

284
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,188
I have to believe in me that you believe in

285
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:26,719
A story just started, carrying a name

286
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:34,731
Whether it's a coincidence or a fate,
who cares?

287
00:22:34,756 --> 00:22:40,716
Just pick one thing in here

288
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:48,115
Just from once chance,
the future would change

289
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,645
Along with the sky, the wind, and the land

290
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:01,451
It's all because you keep
believing in that possibility

291
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:08,162
That I can also keep believing.
With my power...

292
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:11,473
In the depths of the world
that we must protect,

293
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,677
rise up as many times as it take

294
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:20,740
If I can't hold it with both hands,
I'll lend it to you

295
00:23:21,471 --> 00:23:28,181
Even if you got shaken, face forward
for the smile you wish to protect

296
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:33,078
There's a scenery I want to show you,

297
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,518
let's go together
