1
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,440
1014 A.D. YORK, NORTHUMBRIA
DAY OF ROYAL COUNCIL MEETING

2
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,450
What's in the barrel?

3
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,700
Wine.

4
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,330
There are so many soldiers.

5
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,670
Well, of course.

6
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,590
A great many lords
are gathering here today.

7
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,970
Wow.

8
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,300
And are these lords going to eat all this?

9
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,120
You can't be serious.

10
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
-You're exaggerating.
-No, it's true!

11
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,380
The guy was nearly stabbed
and didn't even notice.

12
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,130
He really is oblivious.

13
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,930
So, what do you think
really happened yesterday?

14
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,610
There was an assassination attempt.

15
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,240
The implication is troubling,
but we can't entirely ignore the rumors.

16
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,070
So the king prefers
Prince Harald over Prince Canute?

17
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,160
The Canute faction can't be too pleased.

18
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,250
Lower your voice.

19
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,580
It's still only a rumor.

20
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,710
We may have to change our plans.

21
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,590
Moreover, Canute has succeeded
in bringing Thorkell to his side.

22
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,840
And he more than compensates
for the loss of Ragnar.

23
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,600
Yes, but Thorkell
isn't capable of governing.

24
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,980
Prince Canute
may not be able to control him.

25
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,940
Then there are the other two
who've recently joined Canute's side.

26
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,530
I believe his name is Askeladd,
meaning "of the ashes."

27
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,030
That's a name I haven't heard.

28
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,820
Lords!

29
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,570
Please rise!

30
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,450
His Majesty the King and His Royal
Highness the Prince have arrived!

31
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,310
Look at that mountain of food!

32
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,200
What happened to Thorfinn?

33
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
Not sure.

34
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,080
But you needn't worry
about having a guard at this time.

35
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,580
No one would be so foolish
as to attack you here and now.

36
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,950
Can't you wretches walk any faster?
Hurry up!

37
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,170
Stupid kid.

38
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,640
Hey!

39
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,250
Huh? What do you want?

40
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,600
What? It's just a kid.

41
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,100
Hold on!

42
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,440
How dare you grab me
with your filthy paws!

43
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,770
What's with this kid?

44
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,690
Look at us, you little bastard.

45
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,450
Hey!

46
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,780
Can you talk?

47
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,120
Is he for real?

48
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
You some kind of joker?

49
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,250
Give us whatever you have.

50
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,300
You little--

51
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,110
Get out of my way!

52
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,490
You morons!

53
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,910
You again?

54
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,920
You'll be sentenced later.
I can't waste time on a day like this.

55
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,500
Is this a good idea?

56
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,300
I heard he's the prince's personal guard.

57
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,470
The prince is attending the Royal Council.

58
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,510
His guards aren't wandering
the streets at a time like this.

59
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,150
You are the eminent lords of Denmark.

60
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,740
You have done well to gather here today.

61
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,660
After pursuing the dream for many years,

62
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,750
my dominion over the country of England
has finally been formalized.

63
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,130
This great day has come to pass
because of your courageous efforts.

64
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,970
Furthermore, my faithful friend Thorkell

65
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,140
and my dear son Canute

66
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,520
have returned home
under the divine protection of the Gods.

67
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,610
It is an extraordinary happiness.

68
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,110
I am pleased you have returned, Canute.

69
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,820
Your father is overjoyed.

70
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,670
Of our new territory,
I bestow on you Mercia to govern.

71
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,840
We will work together
to bring prosperity to this land.

72
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,880
Thorkell.

73
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:04,140
It is my wish that you
provide support to my son.

74
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,060
Gladly.

75
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,520
Mercia?

76
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,730
The richest land in all of England?

77
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,440
I guess the rumors were unfounded.

78
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,400
Well, you never know.

79
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,740
He might be saying that
precisely because they are true.

80
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,620
Gentlemen, I will also reward you
according to your merits in battle.

81
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,450
In addition, let us ready all our strength
for our next campaign in Ireland.

82
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
The land of Ireland

83
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,130
is where the odious tyrant Brian Boru

84
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,180
fought our armies and dealt
a bitter loss to our late King Harald.

85
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,680
I  did it!

86
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,100
The king reacted just as I had predicted.

87
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,560
He had no way of contravening my strategy.

88
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,230
In the battle of wits,
I have gained the upper hand.

89
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,120
What a reaction on Floki's face.

90
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,200
Sorry, but you'll be pulling
the short end of the stick from now on.

91
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,000
In this fight, I'll be taking the lead.

92
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,750
All the pieces are in place.
I alone can make this work!

93
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,550
However, gentlemen…

94
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,550
this land remains occupied

95
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,510
by impudent men
who know not how to respect a king.

96
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,930
I must address this issue.

97
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,980
I sent envoys who offered
these kingdoms to become my vassals.

98
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,030
I have made the offer twice.

99
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,030
Despite my efforts, they flatly refused.

100
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,500
If rebellion is threatening
to take root in the new territory,

101
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,370
we must spare no effort
to weed it out completely!

102
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,840
Wales.

103
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,840
We will show it's people

104
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,850
just how much power
a real king can wield to reach his goal.

105
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,310
Next spring, we will lead a charge.

106
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,150
Prepare yourselves, gentlemen.

107
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:39,960
Wake up.

108
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,630
Did you hear me?

109
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,470
Wake! Up! Now!

110
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,760
You've got a visitor!

111
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,430
Is it one of Canute's men?

112
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,270
Turn him away.

113
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
Why would it be one of Canute's men?

114
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,570
He's just a sailor.

115
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,330
Thorfinn.

116
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,850
A merchant told me that someone fitting
your description had been arrested.

117
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,650
I was alarmed, Thorfinn.

118
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,490
It's got nothing to do with you.

119
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,040
It's been eleven years.

120
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,580
You have suffered much anguish.

121
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,710
It is just as you said.

122
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,550
I could never understand.

123
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,430
As long as that man is alive,
your heart will never be at peace.

124
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,600
If you say you remain unsatisfied…

125
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,310
then it must be true.

126
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,110
However…

127
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,620
I remember our lives
as if it were yesterday.

128
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,130
The crackling hearth.

129
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,460
The smell of hearty stew.

130
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,380
Thors.

131
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,760
Helga.

132
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,220
Ylva.

133
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,010
And…

134
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,810
your smile when you were a child.

135
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,110
I once told you

136
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,610
about how I was trapped by an ice floe
off the coast of Brattahlid.

137
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,080
The food had run out
and my ship was wrecked.

138
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,130
All six of my companions were dead.

139
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,720
Regardless,

140
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,350
I continued to walk across the ice.

141
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,100
Do you know why?

142
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,360
Because no matter how violent the sea,

143
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,740
or how frozen the water…

144
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,680
a seaman never gives up
his fight with the sea

145
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,850
just like a warrior!

146
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,820
This is how we maintain our honor!

147
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,780
When Thors left this world,

148
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,660
and you disappeared,

149
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,250
I made a promise
and put my honor on the line.

150
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,420
That's why, Thorfinn,

151
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,500
I don't say this for your sake alone.

152
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,340
It is for my own sake!

153
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,890
I will take you home
back to Iceland no matter what!

154
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,060
This is how I will bring honor
to the memory of Thors!

155
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,070
Next, we will hear
from the lord of Schleswig,

156
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,950
son of Erik,

157
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,490
Lord Ivar.

158
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,570
Come forth.

159
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,700
For your victories in battle,

160
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,410
the king grants you this silver
and land in the new territory.

161
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,710
Accept your reward with honor.

162
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,300
It seems the news had no effect on him.

163
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,140
He's only just heard it.

164
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,850
But the blood went from his face
when you said "Wales."

165
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,140
Wales.

166
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,350
He may have a weakness
in connection with that country.

167
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,310
We should bear this in mind.

168
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,290
Slow down a bit.
Don't devour everything like a boar.

169
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,660
Shut up!

170
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,000
This is how I honor
the God of the harvest.

171
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Are you trying to get even more gigantic?

172
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:17,920
Damn it.

173
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,640
What the hell was that?
This I didn't expect from King Sweyn?

174
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,390
Has he learned
of my relationship with Wales?

175
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,680
No, that's highly unlikely.

176
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,730
I didn't tell Floki.

177
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,770
And even if he knew,

178
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,690
the king wouldn't redirect
his entire army just to antagonize me.

179
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,900
Then, maybe it's just be a coincidence?

180
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,910
Never mind, that doesn't matter.

181
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,500
The problem is that come spring,
Wales will be turned into a sea of fire.

182
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,580
Damn it.

183
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,590
Think.

184
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,380
There is no time.

185
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,590
What can I do before spring?

186
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,180
Have the prince lead a revolt?

187
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,720
No. In that case,
I could only rely on Thorkell's 500 men.

188
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,720
We'd be completely outnumbered.

189
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,770
It will take time
to bring the generals to our side.

190
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,070
Perhaps, I could I incite
a civil war among the English?

191
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,320
That's no good!
Wales would be the main battlefield.

192
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,030
War can't be the solution.

193
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,740
Besides, the king's assassins

194
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,370
could take advantage of the confusion
and kill Prince Canute.

195
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,710
Go home?

196
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,220
Now, of all times?

197
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,940
Far to the west,

198
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,520
beyond the sea…

199
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,820
there is a new land
where the fruit is plentiful

200
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,950
and waves of green grass
ripple across the hills and meadows.

201
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,420
This is Vinland.

202
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,670
Thorfinn.

203
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,550
Vinland!

204
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,770
Come back home,
and once things settle down,

205
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,310
we can look for Vinland together!

206
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,110
Why?

207
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,820
Because you yourself said it!

208
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,660
You said Thors wanted to go there.

209
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,750
Thors resettled in Iceland
to escape the fighting.

210
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
If he were alive…

211
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,880
I am sure Thors
would have wanted to find this place.

212
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,520
A place without slavery or war,

213
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
where everyone can live in peace

214
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,100
in a rich and abundant land.

215
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,770
We can do it.

216
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
In Vinland…

217
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,950
In Vinland, I'm sure we could do it!

218
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,220
By the way,

219
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,020
about Wales.

220
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,020
When I was pursuing you,
you evaded me by disappearing into it.

221
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,530
What trick did you use to pull that off?

222
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,030
How did you get the Welsh
to help a Danish army?

223
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,540
My mother's grave is there.

224
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,090
That land…

225
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,090
is my home.

226
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,300
My country.

227
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,270
The land is poor.

228
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,730
But the people are proud.

229
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
It is the country my mother loved.

230
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,610
I see.

231
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,780
Well in that case,

232
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,820
I'm sorry.

233
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,830
I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone.

234
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,710
I know.

235
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,790
Retainer to Prince Canute,

236
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,800
son of Olaf, Askeladd.

237
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,840
Come forth.

238
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,720
Here we go.

239
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,620
I wonder why

240
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,750
my luck runs out

241
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,750
at the very last moment.

242
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
