1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,310
Something flashed.

2
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,790
Is that so?

3
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,500
Then this is where we part.

4
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,170
Excuse me, but I'm in a hurry.

5
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,530
You bastard better not get too cocky.

6
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,320
If you want to leave,
wash your asses in the river

7
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,080
and line up behind Thorkell.

8
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,910
That'll settle everything.

9
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,420
Thorkell doesn't want our asses.
It's the prince's.

10
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,710
Now, Askeladd.

11
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,460
We've served you for years.
We'd rather not kill you.

12
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,630
Leave us the prince and disappear.

13
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,700
Avalon?

14
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,040
Is that the name of a land?

15
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,540
Yes.

16
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,920
The name of a paradise.

17
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,300
Your great ancestor Lord Artorius…

18
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,300
He is in that land.

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,800
But Mother,

20
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,140
Lord Artorius is a legendary general
from a long time ago.

21
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,770
Is he really still alive?

22
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,780
Avalon is

23
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,490
a far off distant land,
beyond the western sea.

24
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,700
It is an island where
fairies live and spring is eternal.

25
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,000
It is a land where no one ages or dies.

26
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,420
That is where

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,540
he is recovering from his battle wounds.

28
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,720
Once he is healed,

29
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,840
Lord Artorius

30
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
will return to us from that distant land…

31
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,480
and deliver us from our suffering.

32
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,190
When that time comes,

33
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,650
you must serve him.

34
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,120
He is the true king and a great warrior.

35
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,120
Become his wisdom.

36
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
Become his sword.

37
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,880
Someday…

38
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,550
May I speak

39
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,970
before saying goodbye?

40
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,350
There's no point..

41
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,350
We have spent
a long time together over the years.

42
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,020
We've celebrated

43
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,190
and drank together.

44
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,900
We've waded through the carnage of battle.

45
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,870
But there is something
I have kept from you.

46
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,750
For the entire decade
we have spent together…

47
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,790
I have despised you
from the very bottom of my heart.

48
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,760
Pigs are better than you imbecile Danes.

49
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,190
Damn it!

50
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,270
Get the prince!

51
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,270
Thorfinn!

52
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,290
Hold on to something, brats!

53
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,540
We're leaving!

54
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,460
Damn you!

55
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,380
Damn it. They saw this coming.

56
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,340
After them! Don't let them escape!

57
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,170
Go!

58
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,010
Not if I have anything to do with it!

59
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,470
Forget him! Go after the sled!

60
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,640
Go!

61
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,690
My men are so predictable.

62
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,860
You've assessed the situation well.

63
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,650
Now then…

64
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,830
This isn't looking good for me.

65
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,960
Seems you've lost faith in me.

66
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,340
I can't make it out from here.

67
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,510
But they seem to be arguing.

68
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,310
They're having a falling out.

69
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,430
It happens in these situations.

70
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,230
-Pathetic.
-Everyone's scared of dying these days.

71
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,230
This is truly disgraceful!

72
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,700
How could they start a fight without me?

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,280
-That's what bothers you?
-Don't start without me!

74
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,500
Surround them!

75
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,250
Take out the horses!

76
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,050
What are you waiting for?
Kill them, Thorfinn!

77
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,350
Throw your knives!

78
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,600
Shut up! I have nothing to throw!

79
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,730
Damn it. Askeladd isn't coming.

80
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,100
What the hell is that geezer doing?

81
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,650
Stop, Bjorn!

82
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,360
Listen to us!

83
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,860
Do you take me for a fool
to think I'd stop?

84
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,860
Me of all people?

85
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,200
Think about it, Bjorn!

86
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,500
Our survival depends
on how we use the prince!

87
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,330
It's pointless, Atli!

88
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,380
Bjorn is Askeladd's right-hand man!

89
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,500
You won't persuade him!

90
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,210
We have to kill him!

91
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,260
That's right! He's starting to get it.

92
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,140
Askeladd left the prince in my care
because he trusts me.

93
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,640
If you want to take the prince,

94
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,890
then come at me, you cowards!

95
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,060
Wait, stop! I told you to attack me!

96
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,310
Not the horses!

97
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Hey, wait!

98
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,610
We're flipping over!

99
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,340
Hey! Thorfinn's getting away!

100
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,840
Let him go!

101
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,560
Prince, are you alive?

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,310
Don't be so reckless!

103
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,600
-Prince!
-Think first!

104
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,690
He's alive.

105
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,610
All right, let's go back.

106
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,540
You cowards aren't gonna come after me?

107
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,580
You survived too, Bjorn?

108
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,460
That mushroom!

109
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,210
You should attack all at once.

110
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,970
I'll send you to Valhalla as a group!

111
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,640
Damn it!

112
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,390
That geezer's such a pain in the ass!

113
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:51,180
Don't die before I can kill you,

114
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,400
Askeladd!

115
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,620
Good grief.

116
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,790
How tedious old age is.

117
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,710
To think that I, Askeladd,

118
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,840
can't see a way out,
being surrounded by a mere 50 men.

119
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Pace yourself.
Wait for the right time to escape.

120
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,130
Thorkell's army will be here soon.

121
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,640
They'll  wreak havoc.

122
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:17,850
That hurt, you little shit!

123
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,240
Did you see that?

124
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:28,990
I did.

125
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,450
Right through the helmet.

126
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,660
I couldn't even do that with an ax.

127
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,660
Damn, he's still as strong as ever.

128
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,340
Damn it.

129
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,760
I lost my temper.

130
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,640
Come on guys, I'm sorry for yelling.

131
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
Come now.

132
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,100
This old man isn't angry anymore.

133
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,190
You on the east side!
Get back or you'll be hit with an arrow!

134
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,160
Here come the arrows.

135
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,910
Torgrim!

136
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,830
You in charge?

137
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,580
So what if I am, you old geezer!

138
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,670
You sure about this?

139
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,710
You could kill me.

140
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,170
I don't care!

141
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,130
Bjorn and Thorfinn are highly skilled.

142
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,340
They might have killed your pursuers.

143
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,310
If that's the case,
you'll need my help retrieving the prince.

144
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,480
If you take me hostage,

145
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,320
Bjorn would come back
to trade the prince for me.

146
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,320
But that's only if I'm alive.

147
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,660
What do we do, Torgrim?

148
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Aim for his legs.

149
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,920
We got him!

150
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,890
This isn't like you, Askeladd.

151
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,400
You've never been such a desperate man.

152
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,280
If the risk outweighed the reward,
you'd always withdraw from a fight.

153
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,740
So why risk your life
for that coward prince now?

154
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,080
Do you plan to be buried
with your reward?

155
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,380
I'm an old man.

156
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,800
I don't have a lot of time left
to work in comfort.

157
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,300
So naturally…

158
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,050
I can't wait any longer.

159
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,650
I can't keeping waiting
for the true king to return from Avalon.

160
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,790
I don't get it. What's he talking about?

161
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,260
Enough. Apprehend him.

162
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,130
What are you waiting…

163
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,430
Hey there.

164
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,020
Are you guys having a good time?

165
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,610
Which one of you is the leader Askeladd?

166
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,780
I most certainly want to meet him.

167
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,490
You're in trouble.

168
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,580
Now, we've got an unexpected visitor.

169
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,150
Yep.

170
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,400
You are a giant.

171
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,190
Now that I see you up close.

172
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,580
My name is Torgrim.

173
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,740
We won't fight.

174
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,700
Please hear me out.

175
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,930
Commander!

176
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,840
The prince isn't here.

177
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,720
That's right!

178
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,930
That's what I wanted to tell you.

179
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,940
We were planning
to hand the prince over to you.

180
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,070
But our leader, Askeladd, let him escape.

181
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,320
But don't worry!

182
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,320
We've got ten skilled men pursuing him.

183
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,070
Either way,
please let us handle the prince.

184
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,490
In the name of Odin,
we will surely capture him!

185
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,620
We've got other advantages too.

186
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,830
As I was saying…

187
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,430
So you're Askeladd?

188
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,430
You look like a wise man.

189
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,180
By the way,

190
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,190
I don't see Thorfinn. Where is he?

191
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,850
Did you kill him?

192
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,520
I didn't kill him.

193
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,860
I had him protect the prince.

194
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,650
He's nothing to do with this mutiny.

195
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,280
Is that so?

196
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,160
I'm relieved to hear that.

197
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,910
All right.

198
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,420
You goons have waited long enough!

199
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,880
Except for Askeladd,

200
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,300
kill them all!

201
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,020
This wasn't supposed to happen, Torgrim!

202
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,690
Come on, guys.

203
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,190
Pick up your weapons.

204
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,400
You should die like warriors.

205
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,070
Hurry up. Come on.

206
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,280
I'm saying this for your own sake.

207
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:47,830
You won't go to Valhalla
if you die unarmed.

208
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,340
Damn it!

209
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,520
All right. This is more like it.

210
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,350
Wait, Thorkell!

211
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,850
Are you sure this is what you want?

212
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,980
If you kill us, you won't get the prince!

213
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,070
You know, I'm sure
I'll capture him on my own.

214
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,990
Here. Take your ax.

215
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,450
Come at me.

216
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,080
Try to feel good
about your death as a warrior.

217
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,920
One, two, three, four.

218
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,090
I feel for you, Torgrim.

219
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,600
-From the bottom of my--
-Shut up!

220
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,680
This is all your fault!

221
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,770
Give it up, Torgrim.

222
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,100
You're good as dead.

223
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,570
You're going to die for sure.

224
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,910
So you might as well
go out fighting, right?

225
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,620
Le me help you.

226
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,250
Now, fight me.

227
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,790
Come on.

228
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,540
Attack me.

229
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
Oh my.

230
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,060
I over did it this time, didn't I?

231
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,400
He's no good.

232
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,860
He's lost his spirit.

233
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,990
Hello?

234
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,090
What's that?

235
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,420
A horse?

236
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,600
Thorfinn!

237
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,370
Here we go!

238
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,470
Greetings, Thorfinn!

239
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,600
You seem well.

240
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,640
Don't touch Askeladd!

241
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,390
He's my prey!

242
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,770
If you lay a finger on him, I'll kill you!

243
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,900
You got that, giant?

244
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,570
Touch him and you die!

245
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,110
I…

246
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,110
I knew he was an idiot.

247
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:16,040
And now this mouse
is picking a fight with a bear.

248
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,130
Your prey?

249
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,630
Isn't this guy your boss?

250
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,630
He's not my boss!

251
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,050
Did you hear that?
That kid's out to fight the commander.

252
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,890
If that's true, he really is fearless.

253
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
Give Askeladd to me.

254
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,230
If you don't, I'll kill you.

255
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,110
Really?

256
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,610
Then I won't hand him over.

257
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,240
Did you hear that?

258
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,950
Thorfinn and I will be fighting a duel
to decide which one of us gets Askeladd!

259
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,620
You are all witnesses!

260
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,380
-All right!
-Kill him!

261
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,710
Bastard. Deciding that on his own.

262
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,260
Thorfinn.

263
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,100
If you win, I'll let him go.

264
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,020
I'll even give you a horse.

265
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,280
Trust me.
This won't go like it did back in London.

266
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,280
I would expect nothing less

267
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,320
from the son of Thors…

268
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,500
last descendant of a great warrior family!

269
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
