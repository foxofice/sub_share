1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,850
Now then, what do I do?

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,150
How do I protect my country
from these animals?

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,200
For the successful rescue of the prince,

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,870
you are granted 50 pounds of silver.

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,910
Accept it with honor.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,040
I was told you fought valiantly
to ensure Canute's safe return.

7
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,090
I am deeply grateful.

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,550
Your Majesty, I humbly accept your gift.

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,180
I expect great things from you
in our fight to subjugate Wales.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,190
So, the sly, old fox
figured it out after all.

11
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,070
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,030
please forgive me
for speaking out of place.

13
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,290
Regarding the upcoming
campaign in Wales…

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,830
are you certain
that this is the best decision?

15
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,050
I believe the Wales campaign next spring

16
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,600
will only bring you a minimal benefit.

17
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,270
I advise you to reconsider.

18
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,150
Askeladd.

19
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,190
I order him to create no friction.

20
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,860
So this is Askeladd.

21
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,650
To directly contradict
the king to his face…

22
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,030
He's got some nerve.

23
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,790
Forgive me, Your Highness.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,710
But Wales is the one thing
I just cannot forgo.

25
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,500
Explain your reasoning.

26
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,630
Thank you, Your Highness.

27
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,100
First of all, we have just spent
ten years fighting the English.

28
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,640
Right now, I believe we should be

29
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,430
recovering the losses
of the country and the people.

30
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,770
Then, there is also the matter
of Wales's harsh and poor landscape.

31
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,860
It would be like whipping tired horses
to chase a rabbit

32
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,410
and end up stepping off a cliff.

33
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,540
In short, the conquest of Wales
is not worth the effort.

34
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,290
-That's true.
-He makes a good point.

35
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,460
He does have a way with words.

36
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,760
It is not a conquest.

37
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,510
We must ensure
that the insolent know their place.

38
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,800
Make no mistake.

39
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,100
If you are worried about their actions…

40
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,020
please allow me to be your envoy.

41
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,810
I will show you that the Welsh
can indeed be convinced.

42
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,360
Are you telling the king
he must humble himself a third time

43
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,570
to those whom you would call "rabbits"?

44
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,410
Precisely because it is a third time,

45
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,830
Your Majesty's magnanimity
will be conveyed to them.

46
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,580
I beg you to heed my advice.

47
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,060
Oh, he's in for it now.

48
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,990
This is what a loyal vassal looks like.

49
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,530
There is no greater treasure
to a king than a remonstrance.

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,960
My army is replete
with truly brave men like him.

51
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,500
Your praises are wasted on me.

52
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,040
Well, that's boring.

53
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,180
Continue to lend me your strength.

54
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,060
Wales or Canute. Choose.

55
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,270
To be honest,
I have little care for Wales.

56
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,070
Give me Canute's head and come to my side.

57
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,990
Do so, and I will overlook Wales.

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,790
I did some research on you.

59
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,210
It seems your mother
was a slave after all.

60
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,630
I have a guess as to why you are
so insistent about Wales.

61
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,800
It seems the people

62
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,380
from that country really are slaves.

63
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,430
What do you think?
It's still ready for action.

64
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,400
It's the ship you've always
wanted to sail on.

65
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm finally letting you board it.

66
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,080
Just rest
until Mols and the others return.

67
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,990
-Hurry and take this.
-All right.

68
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,890
Come on! Be careful!

69
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,140
Yes, sir.

70
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,290
You must be starved.

71
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,000
Just wait. I've got some great beef jerky.

72
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,590
Thorfinn!

73
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,010
Thorfinn!

74
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,090
Where did you go? Thorfinn!

75
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,020
Thorfinn.

76
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,000
What a disgraceful face.

77
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,080
To let the crown
rest atop a face like that

78
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,420
is unforgivable.

79
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,680
-What?
-Did he just say that to the king?

80
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,430
What did you just say?

81
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,980
Have you gone def you old bastard?

82
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,060
I said a shining crown
shouldn't be worn by ugly filth.

83
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,650
What?

84
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,150
You do not have the face of a king.

85
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,530
Gurads, stand down!

86
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,790
The king

87
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,750
is within my reach.

88
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,250
Is he serious?

89
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,210
Good Gods.

90
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,970
Askeladd.

91
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,640
You bastard! King Sweyn is my--!

92
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,970
Don't move, Thorkell!

93
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,810
Askeladd is not himself!

94
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,890
Do not provoke him!

95
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,690
Lower your sword.

96
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,730
Do so,
and I will forgive this impertinence.

97
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,490
Forgive?

98
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,320
Don't get carried away, you barbarian.

99
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,080
For the mockery
of my family and my people,

100
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,580
you deserve certain death!

101
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,960
This is your final warning.

102
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,000
Lower your sword.

103
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,080
Askeladd.

104
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,170
That is an epithet.

105
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,760
I will tell you the true name
bestowed upon me by my mother.

106
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,390
Lucius Artorius Castus.

107
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,350
I am

108
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,270
the rightful king
and ruler of all Britannia.

109
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,320
Men attack!

110
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,890
That felt good.

111
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,560
Now then…

112
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,160
Why aren't you attacking?
Get him!

113
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,410
After him, men!

114
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,830
This fiend has killed the king!

115
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,330
Execute him!

116
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,840
Hey, what's going on?

117
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
What?

118
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,360
What the hell is he doing?

119
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,530
What is happening in there?

120
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,660
What is he doing?

121
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,740
How dare you, idiot!

122
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,720
What's wrong?

123
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,260
Whoever wants to die next, come forward!

124
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,970
The king of Britannia
will kill you himself!

125
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,390
Faulter notl!
Overwhelm him with your numbers!

126
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,780
Die!

127
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,030
Hurry up!

128
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,280
Don't push!

129
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,910
-Get out!
-Stop pushing!

130
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,240
Move!

131
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,410
Damn it. Out of the way!

132
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,420
Askeladd!

133
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,420
Endure it, Thorkell.

134
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,260
Wait your turn.

135
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,930
That doesn't matter anymore!

136
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,800
He's lost his mind.

137
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,230
What I hate most
is when someone snatches my prey.

138
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,390
He hasn't lost his mind.

139
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,690
That's just an act.

140
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,690
What?

141
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,240
He merely chose to save both me and Wales.

142
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,070
Acting like he's mad is his way
of taking blame for murdering the king.

143
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,290
For now, let him rampage.
I'll let you land the finishing blow.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,330
I don't care.

145
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:04,960
Thorkell.

146
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,630
You say he is your vassal.

147
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,930
The owner of a mad dog
should be the one to put him down.

148
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,100
What's wrong, you Danish bastards?

149
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,360
Askeladd!

150
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,530
You bastard.

151
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,740
Do you understand what you've done?

152
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,490
You murdered the king!

153
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,200
What are you talking about?

154
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,120
I'm here, alive and well.

155
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,870
Shut the hell up!

156
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,790
You bastard son of a slave!

157
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,130
You piece of shit.

158
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,630
Is that any way to speak to your king?

159
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,510
Kneel before me!

160
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,810
I'll let you have the honor
of kissing my boot

161
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,220
and dying!

162
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,060
Askeladd!

163
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,320
Stay back, Thorfinn!

164
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,430
Is this your first time
stabbing someone, Prince?

165
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,440
Well done.

166
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,490
Hey! Askeladd!

167
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,040
Hey, look!

168
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,960
What?

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,290
He killed him?

170
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,880
The prince did it!

171
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,550
Stand up properly.

172
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,270
This is important.

173
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,520
The stage is set for you.

174
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't waste it.

175
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,480
Get up, you old geezer!

176
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,110
What are you doing here
taking a casual nap?

177
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,410
Damn it! Goddamn it all!

178
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,490
You got yourself stabbed
in the the heart, you moron!

179
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,330
My God, you are such a pain.

180
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,080
Just let me rest a while.

181
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,540
Bastard! Stand up now!

182
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,210
We're getting out of here!

183
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,010
You fool.

184
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,760
Hurry and finish me off.

185
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry for making you wait.

186
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,390
I'll give it to you.

187
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,520
My life.

188
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,850
Kill me.

189
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,440
We are

190
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
mutual enemies, aren't we?

191
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,950
You're going to die?

192
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,490
You?

193
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,370
You must hurry then.

194
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,290
There's no time left.

195
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,750
Are you mocking me?

196
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,550
You bastard!

197
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
This isn't supposed to happen!

198
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,550
The way we settle things

199
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,560
isn't supposed to happen like this!

200
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,850
I won't forgive you!

201
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,060
Don't just die!

202
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,980
Stand up!

203
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
Duel me right now!

204
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,820
I'm the one who's supposed to kill you!

205
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,400
Hey, come on! Stop messing around!

206
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:58,820
-Good grief.
-Stand up!

207
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,160
This is why I don't like kids…

208
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,830
Duel me! Get up!

209
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,040
How do you

210
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,290
intend to live?

211
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,170
From now into the future,

212
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,510
long after I've died,

213
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:22,300
how do you intend to live,

214
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:23,800
Thorfinn?

215
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,850
You haven't even thought that far ahead.

216
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,980
Shut up.

217
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,610
Stop this nonsense and just move on.

218
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,360
Doing this forever…

219
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,370
will only keep you
stuck in this worthless place.

220
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,250
Go far, far away.

221
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,250
Go even beyond the land
where Thors went, son of Thors.

222
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,760
That is your…

223
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,300
true fight.

224
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,890
Become a true warrior…

225
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,600
son of Thors.

226
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,890
Thorfinn, I won't ask you to forgive me.

227
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,890
He was punished

228
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,810
for suddenly going mad
and murdering the king.

229
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,350
Therefore,

230
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,480
I believe you do not wish
to serve me anymore.

231
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,610
I release you from my service.

232
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,590
-Kill him!
-He's a traitor, too!

233
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,300
Stop!

234
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,840
Do not kill him!

235
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,300
Step back!

236
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,180
I will decide his punishment!

237
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,560
Thorkell.

238
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,060
It's fine.

239
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,980
Being cut

240
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,060
is a light reparation.

241
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,110
Your Highness.

242
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,860
Let us tend to your wound.

243
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,110
Let me handle things from here.

244
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:48,910
Escort the prince!

245
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,780
Floki.

246
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,040
With the death of the late king,

247
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,290
who do you regard as commander-in-chief
of England's field army now?

248
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,040
Well, that's…

249
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,090
What's wrong?

250
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,800
Speak your mind.

251
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,100
Men, listen to me.

252
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,480
The late King Sweyn has passed away.

253
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
From now,

254
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,570
the role of commander of all armies
and ruler of England

255
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,490
belongs to me, Canute!

256
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,410
The subjugation of Wales is suspended.

257
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,750
With the death of the late king,

258
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,750
the surviving English soldiers
will mount a revolt.

259
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,290
We must prepare for this first.

260
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,970
We will continue the reward
ceremony at a later time.

261
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,050
That is all.

262
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,140
You are dismissed.

263
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,730
-Hey!
-Come on!

264
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,880
Stop already!

265
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,880
-Come on!
-You…

266
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,520
