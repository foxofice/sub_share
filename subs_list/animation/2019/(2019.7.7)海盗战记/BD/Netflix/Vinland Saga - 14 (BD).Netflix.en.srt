1
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,030
God.

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:25,540
Is it truly your will
that we must always remain pure?

3
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,130
Is it true?

4
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,840
That those who ignore your will,
even angels, are to be punished?

5
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,640
That is what my father says.

6
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,560
Someone like me

7
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,440
does not understand all your thoughts.

8
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,860
But to me your heavenly kingdom

9
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,690
remains very far away.

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,110
Anne!

11
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,950
Come help with preparing dinner!

12
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,700
All right! I'll be right there.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,930
You…

14
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,430
You, who are in Heaven…

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,060
watching over all of us down here.

16
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,650
To me…

17
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,770
it is a burden.

18
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,490
O Lord.

19
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,580
Return us

20
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,040
back to your

21
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,500
rightful and just path…

22
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,590
so that we may be reborn.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,960
Redeem our present days

24
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,220
so that we may once again
live as in the days of old.

25
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,480
So what you're saying, father…

26
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,310
It's like

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,440
what my older brother and I have.

28
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,440
We've done everything together
since we were kids.

29
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,570
We grew up helping each other out.

30
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,370
Our teamwork on the battlefield
is second to none.

31
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:54,790
Right?

32
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,080
We know what the other's thinking.

33
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,880
He's the only one I trust
to watch my back.

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,670
The trust we have
can't be traded for silver.

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,630
Right, Brother?

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,130
That's right, Brother.

37
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,840
Well, it depends how much.

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,890
The bond of brothers!

39
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,230
What do you think?

40
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,650
Is this it?

41
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,730
I don't know.

42
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,980
It may be.

43
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,950
But that is quite different
from how I imagine love.

44
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,870
Now see here, father.

45
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,330
You've never been to battle
and have no idea how amazing it is.

46
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,460
We're a superb duo in a cutthroat world.

47
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,000
Could your love do that?

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,010
I think it's wonderful.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,720
You brothers have something
that is irreplaceable.

50
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,810
Now then,

51
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,890
if we stood on the field of battle,

52
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,690
would you make the effort
to watch my back?

53
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,020
What are you talking about?

54
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,820
I do it for him because he's my brother.

55
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,530
I wouldn't let a drunk monk watch my back.

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,070
Certainly not.

57
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,080
That's the difference.

58
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,210
I'm sorry. You gotta explain it
in a way that I can understand?

59
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,250
Besides, take a look at yourself.

60
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,500
You seem to drink a whole lot.

61
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,880
Is that wine your love?

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
No.

63
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,840
I don't drink because I love it.

64
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,600
What?

65
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,970
Then don't drink it.

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,930
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,100
He makes no sense.

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,440
So, you like things that make no sense?
Well, then how about this one?

69
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,820
It's a story we veterans still tell.

70
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,820
A while back, we attacked a ship
in the Faroe Islands.

71
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,530
The ship had one warrior on it.

72
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,000
He was extraordinarily strong.

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,120
We all attacked him at once,

74
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,920
but before we knew it, he'd laid out
30 of us with just his bare fists.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
His bare fists!

76
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,890
Eventually, our arrows put him down.

77
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,760
When we checked the damage,
strangely there were no fatalities.

78
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,310
Now that's a mystery.

79
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,650
He did wield a sword in the end.

80
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,650
Perhaps he realized
he'd underestimated us?

81
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,820
Well, that's insulting.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,860
Honor among warriors is of the--

83
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,910
Did that man…

84
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,490
do anything else?

85
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,330
What was his name?

86
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,250
I…

87
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't know his name.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,960
I seem that

89
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,760
people who make no sense
are drawn to each other.

90
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,760
That man also said something peculiar.

91
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,510
"A true warrior needs no sword."

92
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,310
Or something like that.

93
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,480
You feeling unwell, monk?

94
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,110
Hey, where are you going?

95
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,950
What is it, monk?

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,620
Is that what you mean by "love"?

97
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
A true warrior…

98
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,510
needs no sword.

99
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,850
A true

100
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,480
warrior…

101
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,250
Don't blame me for this weather.

102
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,710
I sail ships.

103
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,630
I know the sea.
This land weather is not my specialty.

104
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,760
To predict how the winter will be
ahead of time is asking too much of me.

105
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,390
That's not what I said.

106
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,180
I said that it seems
that your luck is beginning to run out.

107
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,020
You changed course
to avoid the snow and now look.

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,610
Your men are considerably agitated.

109
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,780
My men have survived the carnage of war.

110
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Something like this won't scare them away.

111
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,700
They're doing just as they're told.
No questions asked.

112
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,290
Turn back.

113
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,330
Traversing Mercia is impossible.

114
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,590
If we push back through the snow,
we'll have to abandon our plunder.

115
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,590
My men wouldn't like that.

116
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,180
Regardless of what we do,
camping here is impossible.

117
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,020
Askeladd, the preparations are complete.

118
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,690
We can go.

119
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,020
Finally.

120
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,020
Askeladd.

121
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,780
When your luck runs out,
everything you plan will come to ruin.

122
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,700
Ragnar.

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,290
Are you suddenly faint-of-heart?

124
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,920
The raiding and plundering of villages

125
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,380
is one of our Nordic traditions.

126
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,310
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

127
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,940
Give us this day our daily bread,

128
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,020
and forgive us our trespasses,

129
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,030
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

130
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,030
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

131
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,240
For thine is the kingdom

132
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,620
and the power, and the glory, for ever.

133
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,700
Amen.

134
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,750
Amen!

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,750
Hey, Papa.

136
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,720
Why do we always pray?

137
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,090
Because Jesus told us to.

138
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,350
What Jesus says is never wrong.

139
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,850
What happens if we don't pray?

140
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,110
If you don't believe,
then you'll go to Hell when you die.

141
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,230
That's right.

142
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,860
Hell is a scary place
where the Devil looms.

143
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,240
You don't like the Devil, do you?

144
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm scared of the Devil.

145
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,950
Yes, me too.

146
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,370
But good children who pray
will go to Heaven.

147
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,170
Remember that.

148
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,880
It doesn't make sense to me.

149
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,930
That someday we'll all
have to go to Heaven or Hell.

150
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,550
I would hate
for our family to be separated.

151
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:16,350
But Father, why would God suddenly wish
to pass judgment on the whole world?

152
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,850
It's not suddenly.

153
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,110
It was decided a long time ago

154
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,650
that it would happen 1,000 years
after the resurrection of Jesus.

155
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,740
In other words, 20 years from now.

156
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,870
By God's judgment,
all that is evil will go to Hell.

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,130
I know!

158
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,090
The evil ones are the Danes!

159
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,340
That's right! They are pure evil.

160
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:50,180
I am sure that God foresaw
their appearance in the world.

161
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,100
Listen, you must make sure
to follow the teachings of Jesus well.

162
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,020
Anne?

163
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,560
I need to pee.

164
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,530
What do I do?

165
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,580
I'm scared of the Devil!

166
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,140
But it's so pretty.

167
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,150
I put it on again…

168
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,860
I wonder how much this ring is worth.

169
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,990
If I pay for it now,
I wonder if God will forgive me.

170
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,330
I must have been tempted by the Devil.

171
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,050
I have no money.

172
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,340
I shouldn't have even gone
to the market to look.

173
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:16,470
Bad children like me
will surely go to Hell on Judgment Day.

174
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,850
I'm certain I'll be
the only one in the family…

175
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,070
who won't go to Heaven.

176
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,210
And it even looks good on my left hand!

177
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,340
Who are they?

178
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,930
What a silly face!

179
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,690
Me too!

180
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't you remember what I said?

181
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,320
If you don't behave, God will punish…

182
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,370
So.

183
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,790
I found dinner.

184
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,920
But thou hast utterly rejected us;
thou art very wroth against us.

185
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,920
Everyone! Please run!

186
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,050
The village is under attack!

187
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,510
-The Danes are coming!
-Shut up, you damn monk!

188
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,180
Do you want to die?

189
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,610
-It's warm in here.
-I feel revived.

190
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,360
What's with this place?
There's so many kids.

191
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,450
What are you doing here?

192
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,830
Barley milk porridge and some dried meat.

193
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,120
Shame, there's onions in it.

194
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,460
Confiscate anything
that could be a weapon.

195
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,380
Got it.

196
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,640
Disgusting. You're eating some awful slop.

197
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,520
Stop that!

198
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,980
What is wrong with you?

199
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,560
Wasting food like that.

200
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,440
You'll be punish!

201
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,490
Are you all right?

202
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,370
Let's see. How do you say it
in English again?

203
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,540
"Give us all your food or…"

204
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,450
Oh, that's right.

205
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,210
-Come on!
-You, old man.

206
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,460
-Come on!
-Over here.

207
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,670
Give me all your food.

208
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,380
Or I'll kill you.

209
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,550
Here's one more.

210
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,270
Is this all?

211
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,570
If food for two kids equals one adult,
then that's 50 people.

212
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,860
That leaves us with food
for 50 people to last the winter.

213
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,120
It's not enough for 104 warriors.

214
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,830
What do I do?

215
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,840
Everyone has been captured.
What should I do?

216
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,340
Father!

217
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,560
As teacher to His Highness,
you are a welcome guest of our group.

218
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,600
We will forgive you this one time.

219
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,270
But if you interfere again,
we will kill you on the spot.

220
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,820
I've never been fond monks anyway.

221
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,110
Are you…

222
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,530
Danes?

223
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,500
Is there anyone among you
who speaks our language?

224
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,550
I beg of you! Half of the food!

225
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,340
Please, leave us at least half!

226
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
We can still make it
through winter with only half.

227
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,270
I have a young child!

228
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,730
Please!

229
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,900
A young child?

230
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,610
That is rough.

231
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,450
Don't worry.

232
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:43,620
I've a plan for you all.

233
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,910
You needn't worry
about surviving the winter.

234
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,660
Really?

235
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,460
Do you really mean it?

236
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,420
I do.

237
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,960
You needn't worry about this
or any other winter.

238
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,260
We will liberate you from your agony.

239
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,470
What?

240
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,350
Askeladd.

241
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,430
They're just plain villagers.

242
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,690
Even if we spare them,
they'll starve without food.

243
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,440
If even one escapes,
they'll reveal our position to the enemy.

244
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,990
I can't let that happen.

245
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,950
How's it going? Have you dug the hole?

246
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,950
Yes. We can probably cram in 62 of them.

247
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,700
Askeladd!

248
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,620
These people are Christians!

249
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,790
What about it?

250
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,880
We're doing all this for the prince.

251
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,630
All right.

252
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,130
Anymore questions?

253
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,430
No one?

254
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,050
In that case,

255
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,760
the order is…

256
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,770
kill them all.

257
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
God.

258
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,550
Are you watching?

259
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,940
Did Father, Mother, Grandfather,

260
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
my younger brothers and sisters…

261
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,740
arrive to you in Heaven?

262
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,010
I guess it is not my fate
to be called up there after all.

263
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,760
Of course not.

264
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,100
Nevertheless…

265
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,560
my heart races so.

266
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,190
I cannot believe…

267
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,400
I cannot believe
that such terrible men exist in the world.

268
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,910
I cannot believe…

269
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,040
that there are men
who fear not your punishment.

270
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,750
Just as the time I stole this ring…

271
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,760
my heart…

272
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,300
races so fast.

273
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,930
