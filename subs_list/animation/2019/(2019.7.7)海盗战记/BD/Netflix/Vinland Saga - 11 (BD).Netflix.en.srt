1
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,690
It's cold.

2
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,440
Anything to drink?

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,910
EPISODE 11: THE GAMBLE

4
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,910
Yes, it really is autumn now.

5
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,920
The season when everything
you eat is delicious.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Especially the fish.

7
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,090
Cod, trout, herring…

8
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,340
Fattened pigs and sheep,
are also delicious, commander.

9
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,850
That they are!

10
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,060
Salted sausages and a stout
to wash it all down!

11
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,770
Save some for me!

12
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,860
At first I didn't like it,
but now I've grown used to English beer.

13
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,110
I like my beer with cheese.
That village with the cheddar was great.

14
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,740
I like the women more than the food.

15
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,330
The women here have the goods.
Just how I like them!

16
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,910
I know! But aren't they modest?

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,370
Maybe, that's because they're Christian.

18
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,710
Must be nice to be Christian.

19
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,130
It's become popular lately.
Maybe I should convert.

20
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,340
Not for me.

21
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,220
Christianity's has all those rules
about what you can and can't do.

22
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,140
Do you remember the wood figure
they prayed to in London?

23
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,180
Didn't he look feeble?

24
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,730
He definitely did.

25
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,020
Yeah!

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,150
He was so frail!

27
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,360
Thor's hammer would destroy him easily!

28
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,150
I heard he was a sorcerer.

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Walking on water, creating more bread.

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,330
What boring sorcery!

31
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,910
Odin and Thor are so much better.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,210
Now.

33
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,830
You mustn't jump to conclusions.

34
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,090
We should ask the opinion
of one of the Christians here.

35
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,420
Hey!

36
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,130
Prince!

37
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,890
Between Jesus and the gods of Asgard,

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,810
who do you think is greater?

39
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,810
What's this?

40
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,270
What's wrong, kid?

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,030
Are you too shy
to talk in front of everyone?

42
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
Don't get cocky, Thorkell!

43
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,830
You faithless scoundrel!

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,660
Do you understand what you're doing?

45
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,040
Are you one to disrespect
His Highness Prince Canute!

46
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,670
I'm not one for taking hostages either.

47
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,970
But King Sweyn has been ignoring me.

48
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,520
I figured if I captured the Prince,
maybe the king would look my way.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,650
You must sympathize with my hurt feelings.

50
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,440
Commander, you sound
like a maiden in love.

51
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,900
Yes! That's exactly how I sound!

52
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,110
I've fallen for my King Sweyn!

53
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,200
You're a gargantuan maiden.

54
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,530
That's our king of the North Sea.

55
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,790
He's fallen completely in love!

56
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,120
What a bunch of lunatics.

57
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,960
All you know is war.

58
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,050
All of you will die!

59
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,720
How do you intend to face the Danish army
of 16,000 with only 500 men?

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,550
That won't happen.

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,810
There's no problem, Ragnar.

62
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,480
Have you been Christian for so long
that you've forgot what it's like for us?

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,360
The honor

64
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,610
of Norman warriors?!

65
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,240
You mean Valhalla?

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,610
That's right.

67
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,200
The Valkyries are always
searching for the souls of the brave,

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,880
for heroes who will serve as einherjar
— the warriors of the gods.

69
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,550
Those who fight and die bravely in battle

70
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,880
will live in the heaven that is Valhalla.

71
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,470
How to fight

72
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,220
and how to die

73
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,270
is all that matters.

74
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,810
The stronger the opponent, the better.

75
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,320
Your beliefs are old.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,610
Really?

77
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,200
A man who runs around
seeking only the battlefield…

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,950
is a miserable one.

79
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,370
You're a child, Thorkell.

80
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,210
You know nothing.

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You know nothing
of the royal court, King Sweyn,

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,750
or my lord, Prince Canute.

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,720
What's that?

84
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,180
I don't get it.

85
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,890
What are you saying?

86
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,600
I see it!

87
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,140
The Lord!

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,850
It's you, isn't it?

89
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,020
Oh, no. He ran out of liquor?

90
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,440
-I'm here!
-Father!

91
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,400
Please sit!

92
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,740
-Get him something strong!
-Reveal yourself!

93
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,410
Please show me your love!

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,830
That never gets old.

95
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,460
Goodness! Sure is tough being a Christian.

96
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,790
Hey!

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,090
Father!

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,590
What do you think?

99
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,430
Who do you think is greater
your god or ours?

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,850
Whoever created the liquor.

101
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,690
That's true!

102
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,730
Liquor is our savior!

103
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,730
Good one, Christian priest!

104
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,380
What's this? Why have we suddenly stopped?

105
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,090
Commander?

106
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,010
Yeah.

107
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,470
Let's see.

108
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,100
Right about over…

109
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,100
there!

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,650
Knew it!

111
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,690
Ambush! On the hill to the right!

112
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,570
Damn it.

113
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Thorkell!

114
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,450
We've got you surrounded!

115
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,200
We are Ragnar's force, 2,000 strong,
commanded by Prince Canute!

116
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,960
Are those my men?

117
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,960
2,000?

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,960
It must be a bluff
if they're declaring themselves.

119
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,920
Hey.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
All right. We got it.

121
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,180
We are willing to show mercy
one last time to you traitors!

122
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,600
Release His Highness and Ragnar now!

123
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,520
Do so and we will spare you this once!

124
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,600
Think well upon your situation!

125
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,060
You…

126
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,780
are not in the position to…

127
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,530
to …

128
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,360
Your Highness!

129
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,780
Ragnar!

130
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
This is going well.

131
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,950
They're more amenable than I thought.

132
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,330
Ragnar's men!

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,500
Job well done!

134
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,920
We will certainly return
Prince Canute into your protection.

135
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,970
No reason to hold back now, right?

136
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,550
Now.

137
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,010
Show me what you got!

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,810
What?

139
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,600
Damn it.

140
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,020
Stop.

141
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,480
Get a grip on yourself.

142
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,400
Withdraw!

143
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,150
But as warriors,
we have no reason to retreat.

144
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,910
They won't run
and they don't intend to be captured.

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,910
If we retreat now,

146
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,910
all of us will be nothing but cowards!

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,960
We have a reason to retreat.

148
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
The prince's safety
takes priority above all else!

149
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,880
Consider the prince's rescue
as your victory!

150
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,340
Hey, what's wrong, boys?

151
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,050
You couldn't possibly be scared
with 2,000 behind you, right?

152
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,060
Or is it something else?

153
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,850
Are you thinking
about using the hostage as

154
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,480
an excuse

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,190
for why you couldn't commit to the fight?

156
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,360
How dare you mock us!

157
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,990
Stop!

158
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,570
Did you not hear my order?

159
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,030
Don't let those war-hungry imbeciles
manipulate you!

160
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,870
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,830
Could it be…

162
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
that I was right all along?

163
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,630
Bring it on!

164
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,710
We'll send you all to Valhalla!

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
Yes!

166
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,220
If you're ready, I'm at your service!

167
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
There's movement.

168
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,310
They've started.

169
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,860
Right. We can all tell that much.

170
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,780
The wind is good.

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
All right, you bastards!

172
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,200
Do it just like we planned.

173
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,580
Aye!

174
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,140
You fools!

175
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,140
Protect the prince!

176
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,430
Degenerates.

177
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,640
At this rate,
it'll be London all over again.

178
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,640
Retreat!

179
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,400
There's still time!

180
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,990
Where's the 2,000?

181
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,240
There's only about 400 of them.

182
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,990
We'll finish this
in less than half an hour.

183
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,210
What is it, commander?

184
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,130
Yes, but do you smell that?

185
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,630
It's something other than blood.

186
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,340
Oh, you're right.

187
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,300
I don't smell anything.

188
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,840
It's not the smell of guts?

189
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,720
No, this is a different smell.

190
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,350
Like we're upwind of fire.

191
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,570
Fire?

192
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,160
All right, next one!

193
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,450
Don't waste time!

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,670
All right, that's it!

195
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,670
Light it!

196
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,560
This is not good.

197
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,400
Commander! Where are you?

198
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,310
Hey.

199
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:43,730
I'm right here.

200
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,690
We're in trouble!

201
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,780
We're in a sea of flames.

202
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,450
We can't see our enemy in this smoke.

203
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,570
This isn't the place for a battle.

204
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,700
The downwind is still good. Let's go.

205
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,660
We can't go to Valhalla
if we die in a wildfire.

206
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,330
A wildfire?

207
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,380
Someone lit this fire.

208
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,710
Huh?

209
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,970
This isn't their doing.

210
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,140
They wouldn't burn themselves
to save the prince.

211
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,270
Which means?

212
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,060
Yeah.

213
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,650
There's a third party

214
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,440
at work here.

215
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,950
It's burning well.

216
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,360
Rain hasn't fallen here for a few days.

217
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,450
How atrocious.

218
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,620
There are many ways to die,
but I hope this isn't how I go.

219
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,500
I'm with you on that.
It's a painful and boring death.

220
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,670
Though it will be a big help
if it kills Thorkell.

221
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,260
Something like this
won't kill that monster.

222
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,090
It just a distraction.

223
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,510
Thorfinn!

224
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,520
All right. Douse him with water.

225
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,320
You saw the prince from afar, right?

226
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,530
He has a red cape
and a helmet with wings.

227
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,440
Remember.

228
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,740
All right. Go.

229
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,250
Hey, Askeladd.

230
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,830
Yeah?

231
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,550
I think we should have joined
Ragnar's 400 men.

232
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,140
Together with our force,
we would have equaled Thorkell's army.

233
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,050
We can't win by being equal.

234
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,680
Even if we won,

235
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
Ragnar's force would claim the victory.

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,190
It's sink or swim either way.

237
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,190
Even if this strategy
burns Prince Canute to death,

238
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,820
we can come from behind
and feign ignorance.

239
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,860
No one can prove we started the fire.

240
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,570
You say that.

241
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,040
But you think
Thorfinn can retrieve the prince?

242
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,910
No matter what you say,

243
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,960
you believe in

244
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,580
that kid.

245
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,130
I'm just good at using fools
who don't know when to be scared.

246
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,810
What is this?

247
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,980
I don't think this is Thorkell's doing.

248
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,690
Either way, we must go now.

249
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,110
Your Highness! Quickly!

250
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,570
Ragnar!

251
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,990
Fool!

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,500
Who thrusts his spear
without checking who he's attacking?

253
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm sorry!

254
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,370
I was just frightened.

255
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,840
What would it mean
if you had lanced the prince?

256
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,380
You idiot!

257
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,920
Your Highness!

258
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,470
Ragnar!

259
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,470
Where are you?

260
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,010
See?

261
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,470
People with common sense check first.

262
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,560
My apologies.

263
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,930
Hey!

264
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,230
His Highness is over here!

265
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,600
Hey!

266
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,770
We're friendly!

267
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,900
Please. Make no sudden--

268
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,860
We found Canute!

269
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,030
We won the prize.

270
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,410
We've found the prince!

271
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,580
Over here!

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,290
Damn it! Thorkell's men.

273
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,170
Looks like I was the fool.

274
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,960
Don't kill the prince.

275
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,090
I know. Be gentle, right?

276
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,050
Come over here, dear prince.

277
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,010
We'll take good care of you.

278
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,400
That was close!

279
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,020
A horse?

280
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,570
Who's this twerp?

281
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,410
What's with those glaring eyes?

282
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,700
You're raring to go, aren't you?

283
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,410
Can we kill him?

284
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,620
Probably. He doesn't look important.

285
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,460
All right, it's settled.

286
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,580
Die, pipsqueak!

287
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,930
Where'd he go?

288
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,110
You are Prince Canute if I'm not mistaken?

289
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,740
I've come to rescue you.

290
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,740
Wait there.

291
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,700
Unbelievable.

292
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,580
Someone's come to save the prince?

293
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,290
But…

294
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,250
Why?

295
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,340
Why is it always that
His Highness is never given a choice?

296
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,970
Thorfinn! Hey!

297
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,060
It's Thorfinn, isn't it?

298
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,820
Well, I'll be. It is you, Thorfinn.

299
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,070
I knew we would meet again.

300
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,530
Thorkell.

301
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,120
Commander!

302
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,370
Do you know
who you're dealing with here?

303
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,330
Is he giving you trouble?

304
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,460
That's because Thorfinn here

305
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,040
is a warrior who gave me
this heavy injury.

306
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,790
Look at this.

307
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,340
Disrespect him and he'll cause you pain.

308
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,340
But wait, Thorfinn.

309
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,600
I must ask you two things.

310
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,480
First,
your group started this fire, right?

311
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,270
Last question.

312
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,780
You said you are
the son of Thors, did you not?

313
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,320
Your father's name is Thors.

314
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,370
Your mother's name is…

315
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,200
Helga.

316
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
Am I wrong?

317
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,000
How do you know?

318
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,050
I knew it!

319
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,220
So you're the Troll of Jom's son!

320
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,550
I can see why you're so strong.

321
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,510
The Troll of Jom?

322
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,560
The son of the great Thors?

323
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,390
He doesn't look like him.

324
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,810
You know my father?

325
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,400
Of course I do!

326
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,150
He's the only man in the world
stronger than me.

327
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,570
A true warrior.

328
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,290
No!

329
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,050
Damn! That's hot!

330
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,010
It seems this is not the time
for reminiscing, Thorfinn.

331
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,680
I'll let you have the prince for now.
We'll do this again later.

332
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,770
We're both headed
for King Sweyn's home base anyway.

333
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,570
If you can evade our pursuit,

334
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,030
then you win!

335
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,280
Don't disappoint me,

336
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,740
son of Thors, Thorfinn!

337
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,330
Hell.

338
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,710
Where is Commander Thorkell?

339
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,790
Commander!

340
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,300
Your Highness! Ragnar!

341
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,550
Huh?

342
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,550
You're the enemy!

343
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,600
Bastard! You're with Thorkell, aren't you?

344
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,940
That Thorfinn of yours is late.

345
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,440
Seems like you put too much faith
in him this time.

346
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,610
That's fine.

347
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,200
No skin off our backs.

348
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,030
More are coming.

349
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,530
Quickly, move the dead!

350
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,880
Don't shoot!

351
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,500
It's me.

352
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,210
I've brought the prince.

353
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,520
Askeladd.

354
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,480
Because of your reckless strategy,
my force has been dispersed.

355
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,940
This is a high crime.

356
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,740
They would have been annihilated
by Thorkell anyway.

357
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,490
Keep your voice down!

358
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,870
However, since we can do
nothing about this situation,

359
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,830
we have no choice but to place
His Highness under your protection.

360
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:03,370
Protect the prince and take him back
to the army's home base.

361
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,460
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf,

362
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,590
humbly accept this appointment.

363
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,470
As such, Your Highness…

364
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,470
as his protector, I wish
to look upon the face of His Highness.

365
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,560
Your Highness.

366
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,580
Prince?

367
