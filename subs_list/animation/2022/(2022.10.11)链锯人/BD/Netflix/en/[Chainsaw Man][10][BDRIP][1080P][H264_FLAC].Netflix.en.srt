FUJIMOTO GENERAL HOSPITAL

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,551
<i>Yesterday afternoon,</i>

3
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:10,137
<i>the Public Safety Devil Hunters
were engaged in a battle</i>

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,099
<i>at the west Nerima building
near Nerima Station.</i>

5
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:15,768
<i>According to witnesses,</i>

6
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:19,396
<i>the criminals included
both Devils and humans.</i>

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,941
<i>The investigation is underway--</i>

8
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,901
Shut up.

9
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:51,053
Hey you! Give me that apple!
Let me eat it!

10
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:53,555
No way! It's all mine!

11
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:56,558
No apples for cowards
who ran away from the enemy!

12
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,310
I didn't run away!

13
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:00,312
I left because I was hungry!

14
00:01:00,396 --> 00:01:02,314
Stop lying, you coward! Chicken!

15
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:04,066
Talking about yourself!

16
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,359
Bitch!

17
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:06,652
-What?
-Let go!

18
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:07,778
Who else…

19
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:13,117
Who else from Division 4 is still alive?

20
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,540
That little one called Kobeni.

21
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:22,209
I think the guy with the glasses is too.

22
00:01:22,293 --> 00:01:23,794
But he quit.

23
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:34,096
Ms. Makima asked for me and Power.
We're gonna split.

24
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:36,849
I was just here for the fruit.

25
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,651
I'll be kind and leave you an apple.

26
00:01:48,152 --> 00:01:49,069
Bye.

27
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:22,728
Curse…

28
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,022
How long do I have?

29
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:30,944
Two years…

30
00:03:41,974 --> 00:03:44,893
<i>Came back for my manga,
but caught him crying.</i>

31
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:49,648
<i>Of course, he's crying.</i>

32
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:51,900
<i>A bunch of his workmates died.</i>

33
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:54,820
<i>And his partner Himeno is dead too…</i>

34
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,408
<i>Come to think of it…</i>

35
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:09,001
<i>Why do I have no tears at all?</i>

36
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:14,840
<i>I was so sad when Pochita died.</i>

37
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,471
<i>But now that it's Himeno…</i>

38
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:26,518
<i>She was the first person to say
she'd be my friend.</i>

39
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,353
<i>Am I too cold?</i>

40
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:31,565
<i>Would I cry if Power died?</i>

41
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:34,985
<i>I don't think so.</i>

42
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,070
<i>What if that guy died?</i>

43
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,323
<i>Probably not.</i>

44
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,453
<i>What if Ms. Makima died…</i>

45
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,880
<i>If she died…</i>

46
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,799
<i>I'd probably be down for a while</i>

47
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,928
<i>and carry on with my happy life
in three days.</i>

48
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,932
<i>Because I'll be happy as long as
I have three meals a day, a bath,</i>

49
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,017
<i>and a good night's sleep.</i>

50
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:13,815
<i>Did I lose not just my actual heart,</i>

51
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,527
<i>but my human heart too?</i>

52
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:24,159
Whatever! Never mind the serious stuff!

53
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:28,830
Unhappy thoughts only make you unhappy.

54
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:31,250
Let's go see Ms. Makima!

55
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,668
How depressing.

56
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,007
Excuse me.

57
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:42,552
Hello.

58
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,138
Wait… Are you crying?

59
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,974
Should we leave him alone?

60
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:48,809
Who are you?

61
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:55,399
We came from Kyoto as advisors
for Division 4 at Ms. Makima's request.

62
00:05:55,983 --> 00:05:58,068
Can I have that apple?

63
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:01,655
Advisors?

64
00:07:28,617 --> 00:07:32,037
CHAINSAW MAN

65
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:37,125
The hotel incident and the latest attack

66
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,712
proved that their target is you, Denji.

67
00:07:41,755 --> 00:07:44,883
I was planning to strengthen Division 4,

68
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:47,344
but almost all its members died.

69
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:49,638
Are you going to train us, Ms. Makima?

70
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:53,016
Unfortunately, I'll be pretty busy.

71
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,185
So I'm introducing you to
someone perfect for this job.

72
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:58,855
He'll be training you.

73
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:11,451
This is…

74
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:15,205
Quiet.

75
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,166
Answer me.

76
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,920
How did you feel when your teammates died?

77
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,171
Not much.

78
00:08:23,255 --> 00:08:24,798
Well, they're dead.

79
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:27,300
Do you want to get revenge?

80
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,011
It's too dark. I don't like it.

81
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:30,929
I agree.

82
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:34,933
Humans or Devils, which side are you on?

83
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,187
Whoever takes care of me.

84
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:40,564
Whoever's winning.

85
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,116
You both…

86
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:52,951
get a perfect score.

87
00:08:55,454 --> 00:08:57,873
People like you are so few.

88
00:08:58,457 --> 00:08:59,708
Excellent.

89
00:09:00,876 --> 00:09:01,960
I like you.

90
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:05,505
He's weird.

91
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,049
Makima, you can go.

92
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,760
Their training begins here and now.

93
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,180
Thank you.

94
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:14,723
Ms. Makima?

95
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:18,852
I'm a Devil Hunter from Division 1.

96
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,688
I'll be happy if you can call me "master."

97
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,607
So do that.

98
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:28,945
I like booze, women, and killing Devils.

99
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,099
I… can't get up…

100
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:04,898
Your muscle and bone structure
is the same as ours,

101
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,193
so you're unable to move
when your neck is snapped.

102
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,779
The difference between you and humans is…

103
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:12,531
I smell blood!

104
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:18,286
You recover by drinking blood.

105
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:23,917
Damn it!

106
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:27,337
What did you do that for?

107
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,509
Makima asked me to train you.

108
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:38,723
For whatever reason,
the Gun Devil wants your heart.

109
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,560
But you're just a small fry
who'll be crushed in no time.

110
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,061
That must have worried her a lot.

111
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,647
Why did you strangle us?

112
00:10:46,231 --> 00:10:48,900
I've trained humans before.

113
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:52,571
But it's my first time with you Devils.

114
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,657
The drunk me was thinking
about what to do.

115
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:57,659
Then…

116
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,496
An idea came to me.

117
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:04,875
I'm the strongest Devil Hunter,

118
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,753
so the Devil who can defeat me
would be the strongest too.

119
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,674
I'll keep hunting you two

120
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,760
until you are able to defeat me.

121
00:11:18,096 --> 00:11:19,723
He's nuts!

122
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:21,057
Totally!

123
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,145
Let's try it again.

124
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,147
An old drunkard or not,

125
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,898
we'll get arrested if we kill him.

126
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,483
Denji.

127
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:11,232
The boy's immortal.

128
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,943
The Fiend's semi-immortal.

129
00:12:14,444 --> 00:12:18,990
And all you think about is
how to bash someone's head in.

130
00:12:19,074 --> 00:12:21,076
Neither of you have human rights.

131
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:26,790
Ever since I was a kid, I was too strong
and constantly broke my toys.

132
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,752
I've always wanted toys that didn't break.

133
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:37,133
I'll turn you into the best.

134
00:12:43,473 --> 00:12:44,474
Kon.

135
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,358
See? It won't come.

136
00:12:53,858 --> 00:12:56,778
You abused the power
and got on its bad side.

137
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,365
It probably won't ever
let you use it again.

138
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:04,035
That sword is the Curse Devil, right?

139
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,371
You can use it a few more times.

140
00:13:07,914 --> 00:13:10,166
So this is what you do as advisors.

141
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,669
I'm glad you're quick on the uptake.

142
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:17,257
We're here to do career coaching
for the humans in the Special Division.

143
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,718
It may sound inappropriate,

144
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,554
but don't you think
it's time to quit after the incident?

145
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:26,641
In fact, someone from
your division did leave.

146
00:13:27,642 --> 00:13:29,561
It's okay if you want to
carry on with this job.

147
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,063
But we need you to be
sufficiently prepared.

148
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:33,940
Prepared?

149
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:36,317
Yes. Prepared.

150
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:40,113
If you're staying, you need to
make a contract with a stronger Devil

151
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:42,782
to contribute to the Special Division.

152
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:47,162
Will you quit and enjoy
the life you have left?

153
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,831
Or will you stay here in this hell?

154
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:54,210
The one who killed my family…

155
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,964
and the one who killed
my partner are both alive.

156
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:02,260
How could I quit?

157
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,807
I see.

158
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,979
It's late. We're leaving for today.

159
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,565
We'll be back tomorrow with the paperwork.

160
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:21,488
Looks like what our senior
in Kyoto told us was true.

161
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,492
Nobody in the Special Division
is in their right mind.

162
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:28,161
"Be careful," they said.

163
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:33,083
You may want to take
an objective look at yourself.

164
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,507
There's a lady here to see you.

165
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:43,259
I'll leave you alone.

166
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:12,914
I'm going home to sleep.

167
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,167
I'll visit you at your place tomorrow.

168
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:48,366
His brain broke again!

169
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:52,287
Come back!

170
00:15:53,329 --> 00:15:54,497
Come back!

171
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:06,009
How many times was I killed today?

172
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:09,262
At least 20.

173
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:13,266
I went unconscious when you died.

174
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:14,851
So I'm not exactly sure.

175
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:22,692
That old man's so strong.

176
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:26,404
I won't be happy at all
if I have to keep living like this.

177
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,574
I worked so hard to be happy.

178
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,868
And now I'm working so hard
and unhappy? That's crap.

179
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,579
Should we run away together?

180
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:37,415
It would be considered
desertion from Public Safety if we did.

181
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:40,585
And then they'd do everything to hunt us.

182
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,388
That drunk bastard!

183
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:56,601
He treated us like his toys!

184
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,686
I'm starting to get really mad!

185
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,938
I got it!

186
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:01,814
Got what?

187
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,234
A way to defeat him!

188
00:17:04,317 --> 00:17:05,944
He's very strong.

189
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:09,697
But alcohol has rotten his brain!

190
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:12,659
We should fight him using our brains!

191
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,702
I see!

192
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:17,664
I've been wanting to do that lately too!

193
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:22,460
Like those smart characters in manga!

194
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,754
Let's kill him with our intellect!

195
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,550
I feel like I've gotten
way smarter already!

196
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,135
You too?

197
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:34,138
I already have 100 ideas in my head!

198
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,641
With our level of intellect,

199
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:39,143
it'll be impossible to lose!

200
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,479
He'll be our toy this time!

201
00:17:45,817 --> 00:17:48,194
I think they live at…

202
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,614
This scent of blood…

203
00:17:51,698 --> 00:17:53,533
That old drunkard is here.

204
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:57,537
Anybody who ruins
our daily life has to die.

205
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:04,544
Super smart operation! Commence!

206
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:20,893
A blood weapon?

207
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,271
They went straight for my head.

208
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:26,524
An ambush, huh?

209
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:29,360
The hunter is now the prey.

210
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,146
Ow!

211
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:08,524
That was your best try yet.

212
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:12,487
A prey will use its brain
at the moment of life or death.

213
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,448
So use your brain to the fullest.

214
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,996
There are two reasons
you failed this time.

215
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:25,750
One, Power used too much blood
fighting like that

216
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,252
and made herself anemic.

217
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,340
Two, Denji failed to predict my attack.

218
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,803
Nice try overall. We're done for the day.

219
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:38,930
I'm going for a drink.

220
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:42,975
Power.

221
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,062
He said we're done for the day.

222
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:48,523
Lucky break.

223
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:07,083
The hunted should never trust
the words of a hunter.

224
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:25,017
Signing a contract with a strong Devil

225
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:28,020
means the contract
will probably be brutal.

226
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,859
We're not doing it to torment you.

227
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,695
When you return to work,

228
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:37,530
you'll be plunging into the lion's cage.

229
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,533
You'll need a weapon to defend yourself.

230
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,881
This is where Public Safety
locks up the Devils they captured.

231
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,176
Find your weapon here.

232
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:08,269
On an unrelated note,

233
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:10,813
is that cute girl from yesterday
your girlfriend?

234
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:14,066
Get your mind out of the gutter.

235
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,201
She's my partner's sister.

236
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,162
Oh, my. Did she hit you?

237
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,705
No.

238
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:30,041
She gave me letters.

239
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,043
Letters?

240
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:45,973
These are the letters my sister sent me.

241
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,477
I think you should read them.

242
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:06,744
IS DAD FEELING BETTER?

243
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:11,999
I'M WELL-FED.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEND ME RICE ANYMORE.

244
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:16,504
HOW'S DAD DOING?
IS HE TAKING HIS MEDICINE ON TIME?

245
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:20,508
I MADE AKI GET EAR PIERCINGS.

246
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:27,515
HOW CAN I GET AKI TO QUIT?

247
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:34,355
HOW CAN I GET AKI TO QUIT?

248
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,743
We'd like you to make a contract
with the Devil in this cell.

249
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,038
It's the Future Devil.

250
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,542
Two people in Public Safety
have a contract with it.

251
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:57,837
One of them gave half their lifespan.

252
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,882
The other gave it their eyes
and their senses of taste and smell.

253
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,845
If it likes you,
you might get a better deal.

254
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:10,933
There you go.
