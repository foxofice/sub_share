00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,810
OCTOBER 1013 A.D.
LONDON, ENGLAND

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:12,820
EPISODE 9: THE FIGHT FOR LONDON BRIDGE

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,580
It's like a bridge.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,950
But it's really more of a fort.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,660
That's London for you.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,880
As a city,
it's resisted attacks for years.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,380
I can feel its history.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,960
This isn't the time
to get sentimental, Askeladd.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,970
This city will give us trouble.

10
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,800
I'm here because you said
it'd be an easy victory.

11
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,220
Sorry about that.

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,850
But I never thought that
we'd be facing Thorkell as our enemy.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,810
Thorkell the Tall?

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,690
He joined London's side for money.

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,070
That traitor.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,570
We're the same when it comes to money.

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,330
I joined the Danes because I thought
King Sweyn had a good chance of winning.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,330
Other clans feel the same.

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,010
They're all desperate to achieve greatness
and get their share of the spoils.

20
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,890
Well, it won't be much
with so many gathered here.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,180
I don't go to war for the money.

22
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,310
I just like killing.

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,310
I can always count on you, Bjorn.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,820
Well, our leaders want
to take a rich city like London.

25
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,660
If they gain control of the River Thames,

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,700
they can establish
a supply route inland to Wessex.

27
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,200
So this battlefield
is being carefully watched?

28
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,000
That's right. If there's one place
you can stand out, it's here.

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,880
That's right.

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,750
Do you have a fun strategy in mind?

31
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,550
It's not really a strategy.

32
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,220
Thorfinn!

33
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,510
Time to go to work.

34
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,930
Bring me Thorkell's head.

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,480
Promise me a reward.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,570
Okay.

37
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,990
The usual, right?

38
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,490
You never change, do you?

39
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,080
You go all in on fights you can't win.
That's where you're just like your father.

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,870
Do not forget, Askeladd.

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,250
My only desire is to crush you
in a duel as warriors.

42
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,340
The next duel will be your last.

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,220
I will rip out your heart
and offer it to my father's spirit.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,520
Then go to work.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,560
We must do our job on the battlefield
before getting what we want.

46
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,900
That is how warriors do things.

47
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,240
My head doesn't come cheap.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,160
I won't just duel you over and over again.

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,870
Go get Thorkell's head.

50
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,470
Hey!

51
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,470
Askeladd!

52
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Huh?

53
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,850
There's a ship approaching the bridge.

54
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,650
It's the Jomsviking ship —
Stag of the Sea.

55
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,570
That's the regiment's envoy.

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,490
So it's Floki.

57
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,990
He'll offer twice the amount
the English are paying him.

58
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,660
He'll try to win Thorkell over.

59
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,000
Thorkell follows the money.

60
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,750
He'll take it, won't he?

61
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,290
Let's wait and see what he does.

62
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,380
Here they come! Just one ship!

63
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,390
This way! Quickly!

64
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,140
Die, you bastards!

65
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,850
Come on! Take them down!

66
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,770
Shoot!

67
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't shoot! We're an envoy.

68
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,440
We wish to speak to Thorkell.

69
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,570
-Take this!
-Damn you!

70
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,900
Die!

71
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,070
We did not come to fight!

72
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,570
Where is Thorkell?

73
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,490
Shut up and die!

74
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,160
Wait.

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,160
Stop.

76
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,750
Alright.

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,670
All of you, cease your attack!

78
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,050
Hey, Floki! It's been a long time!

79
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,180
Glad to see you looking so well.

80
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,760
Enough pleasantries!

81
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,640
We've come to relay a message
from our supreme commander.

82
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,810
His Majesty King Sweyn sends this message.

83
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,440
"The King of England has fled
to the land of the Franks.

84
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,070
It is pointless
to continue your opposition.

85
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,860
Surrender,

86
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,910
and in the name of the god Thor,

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,620
you and your subordinates will
be guaranteed your lives and assets."

88
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,630
Come back to our army, Thorkell!

89
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,670
That is the wish of His Majesty the King.

90
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Is King Sweyn here?

91
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,180
He sure works hard for a man of his age.

92
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,760
Thorkell!

93
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,680
Why are you still pointing
your arrows at your friends?

94
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,270
Have we not spent many years
fighting wars side by side?

95
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Don't be swept away by the wrong current.

96
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,780
Your elder brother Sigvaldi
is also concerned about you.

97
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,780
Wrong current?

98
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,950
I see.

99
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,620
I know who've I've joined.
I fought against them last year.

100
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,130
They really are weak.

101
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:33,010
-A bunch of city weaklings.
-What'd he say?

102
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,920
Is he speaking Norse?

103
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,880
Probably.

104
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,050
The only man who could stand
against the Danish army

105
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,100
is probably Prince Edmund.

106
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,270
This country is falling apart.

107
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,770
So in that case…

108
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,520
Yes, which means…

109
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,730
it's far more interesting

110
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,320
to battle you!

111
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,530
The conversation's over!

112
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,870
Resume the attack!

113
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,780
Wait!

114
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,580
Thorkell!

115
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,870
If you join us now, we'll gladly double
what the English promised you!

116
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,430
Bring it on, Floki!

117
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,640
Evade! Veer full speed to the left!

118
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,270
The Ultimate Keel Wrecker!

119
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,400
Oh no, I missed?

120
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,650
Full speed! Break away!

121
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,780
Men, take them down.

122
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,870
Yes, sir!

123
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,790
Retreat!

124
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,170
Hey, Floki!

125
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,630
Ask King Sweyn for me,

126
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,880
if he's grown tired of always winning.

127
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,350
There was no indication
that he could be convinced.

128
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,230
I see.

129
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,360
How irritating.

130
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,690
What shall we do?

131
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,740
Attack once again immediately.

132
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,010
Shit!

133
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,900
All right!

134
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,610
Damn! They've reached the bridge.

135
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,240
That bastard!

136
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,120
Hurry!

137
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,490
Damn it!

138
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,500
No! We're not hitting them!

139
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,750
Bring more stones!

140
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,500
Out of the way.

141
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,830
Amazing.

142
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,250
Here you go!

143
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,640
Did you see that?

144
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,180
That's my Ultimate Log Drop!

145
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,480
-That's how it's done.
-Impressive.

146
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
Next!

147
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,810
Quickly!

148
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,810
Yes, sir!

149
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,490
What's wrong, army of Sweyn?

150
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,820
Is that all you got?

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,450
If you try harder, I think you can do it!

152
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,540
But at this rate,

153
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,410
it'll take 100 years before London bridge…

154
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,470
Here comes someone interesting.

155
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,220
Thorfinn, can you hear me?

156
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,520
See the giant up front with the log up?

157
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,350
That's Thorkell!

158
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,190
It's no use! Halt the ship!

159
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,480
If we get any closer, we'll be killed!

160
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,230
Rotate to the left!

161
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,610
Hold out a little longer!

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
All right, that's enough!

163
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,700
Jump!

164
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,580
None of you lay a hand on him!

165
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,080
This happy-go-lucky fool…

166
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,460
is mine!

167
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,000
Here we go!

168
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Bastard.

169
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,840
Come on!

170
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,440
You can fight,

171
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,770
young one.

172
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,280
Nobody touch him.

173
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,290
I must answer his surprise attack myself.

174
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,420
It's a one-on-one fight!

175
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,550
Come at me, little one!

176
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,050
One-on-one with bare fists…

177
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
He's mocking me.

178
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,530
He was aiming for my wrist?

179
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Nice one, little man.

180
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,870
No wonder he's confident.

181
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,950
I'm dead if that giant…

182
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,620
lands one hit.

183
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,960
I like you!

184
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,500
This old man is all fired up!

185
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

186
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,220
Oops!

187
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,600
That was a close one.

188
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,020
I can't reach him.

189
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,360
His weak spots are too high up.

190
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,780
His armpit, his neck…

191
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,900
All right.

192
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,950
He's low.

193
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,790
In that case,

194
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,460
I'll kick him!

195
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,620
I'll get in close!

196
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,840
Oh dear…

197
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,930
Ouch, that hurts!

198
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
But now, I've caught you!

199
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,860
-He got him!
-That's it, Captain!

200
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,780
Kill him!

201
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,700
Not yet!

202
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,410
All right!

203
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,740
God damin it.

204
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,750
This is no good.

205
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,920
Thorfinn's getting his ass kicked.

206
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,630
I guess it was impossible after all.

207
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,630
Askeladd, that's the signal.

208
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,220
Oh, it's time to retreat.

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,430
Retreat!

210
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,310
All battalions withdraw!

211
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,810
Oh, no.

212
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,110
The battle finished
as I was playing with the little one.

213
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, it seems they've abandoned you.

214
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,610
Poor thing.

215
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:54,150
And you gave it your all.

216
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,570
Oh, is he dead?

217
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,080
Hey!

218
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,940
You still have your fighting spirit.

219
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,690
For a small soldier,
you're very impressive.

220
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,700
Warrior, what is your name?

221
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,200
Thorfinn.

222
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,290
I am Thorfinn, son of Thors.

223
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,710
Thors?

224
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,090
By "Thors," do you mean--

225
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,090
Oh my, he's gone.

226
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,310
What do we do, Captain?

227
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,220
Shoot him?

228
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,100
No.

229
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,230
We'll let him go for today.

230
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,400
Hey! Warrior Thorfinn!

231
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,490
That was fun!

232
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,820
Let's do it again!

233
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,030
Next time, we'll finish this!

234
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,870
That's a promise!

235
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,210
It hurts…

236
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,720
Kill me please…

237
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,180
Does anyone want to be finished off?

238
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,800
I can do mercy killings.

239
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,480
This one's no good.

240
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,520
He's been gutted.

241
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,350
He can't be saved.

242
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,360
Hey! Bring some onion soup over here!

243
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,740
Torgrim! Deal with this one.

244
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,030
I see.

245
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,330
London won't fall.

246
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,370
No, it's not that it won't fall.

247
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,960
We just need more time.

248
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,420
How much time, Floki?

249
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,510
Well, depending on how much
they've stockpiled…

250
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,890
it could take a year.

251
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,510
No, if all goes well, half a year.

252
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,680
It's already autumn.

253
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,520
We cannot waste time on just one city.

254
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,020
The overall outcome is what's important.

255
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,450
No matter what,
capturing all of England is the priority.

256
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,360
Yes.

257
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,160
Have the main army move west.

258
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,330
I will leave 4,000 soldiers
to continue the siege of London.

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,960
As you wish.

260
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,840
To command the 4,000…

261
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,010
Yes, let's see…

262
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,810
I will leave it to Canute.

263
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,100
It is a good opportunity
to exhibit his prowess as a man.

264
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,060
What?

265
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,520
But this is different
from what we discussed?

266
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:20,610
Didn't you say His Highness
was brought along only to observe?

267
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,120
Ragnar, stand down.
This is His Majesty's will.

268
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,870
The whole of the army can't beat Thorkell.

269
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,250
Fighting with only a fifth
of our strength is impossible!

270
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,080
It would do him no good otherwise.

271
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,130
But…

272
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,050
The battlefield will only compound
His Highness's anxiety.

273
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,800
You're in part
responsible for that, Ragnar.

274
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,930
Perhaps the Christian teachings
are at fault.

275
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,980
He has grown up peculiarly weak
despite being a man.

276
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,310
You have spoiled him as his attendant.

277
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,570
My…

278
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,110
My apologies.

279
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,740
Appoint the siege regiment to Canute.

280
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,780
As his attendant,
you will be his second-in-command.

281
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,510
His Highness…

282
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,840
My shoulder is dislocated.

283
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,340
My right ankle is sprained.

284
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,930
And several ribs are broken.

285
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,140
Damn that monster!

286
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,270
Hey, do you see them?

287
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,650
Well,

288
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,490
most of them are withdrawing.

289
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,990
Which means…

290
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,160
Did we win?

291
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,200
We won?

292
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,160
-They hightailed it out of here.
-Then that means we won.

293
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,000
What is this?

294
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,540
What's going on?

295
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,630
We did it! We are victorious!

296
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,550
What?

297
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,050
Hey!

298
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,510
Hey!

299
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,850
Keep fighting!

300
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,350
Hey, wait!

301
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,060
Hey!

302
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,150
You idiots!

303
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,030
You're just conceding London?

304
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,950
Come back, you cowards!

305
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,860
Fight me!

306
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,710
What a pain.

307
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,830
That bastard Thorkell.

308
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,460
What happened to you? You ended up living.

309
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:31,300
Dear me, you're in a sorry state.

310
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,970
This time you had
a difficult opponent, Thorfinn.

311
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,770
By the way, we are marching to Wessex.
What will you do?

312
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,900
We'll leave you behind if you can't walk.

313
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,470
We'll get paid in Wessex!

314
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:13,680
-I'm itching for a fight.
-Don't you only have one arm?

315
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,390
I'll still take anyone.

316
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,060
I'll kill them.

317
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,110
That was fun!

318
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,820
Let's do it again!

319
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,500
These damn monsters.

320
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,840
What the hell…

321
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,670
is so entertaining about war?

322
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
