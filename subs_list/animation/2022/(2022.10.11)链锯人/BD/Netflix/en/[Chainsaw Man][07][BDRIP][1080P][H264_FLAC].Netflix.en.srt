1
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:08,677
Why did you have to do that for me?

2
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,096
Mind your own business, you bastard.

3
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:16,602
I don't want to owe any more favors.

4
00:00:17,853 --> 00:00:20,648
If we get out, we'll be even.

5
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,408
Thank goodness…

6
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:52,972
I knew you are still alive, Chainsaw.

7
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,058
Die!

8
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,981
It hurts so bad!

9
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,317
Heal!

10
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:08,237
It won't work, Chainsaw.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,238
It hurts!

12
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,740
It hurts so much!

13
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:14,076
My heart is not here.

14
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,369
You can't kill me.

15
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:27,965
Devil…

16
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,967
Doesn't look good.

17
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:32,803
Denji keeps losing blood.

18
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:36,348
His chainsaw will retract
if that continues.

19
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:45,024
You are so much weaker than before.

20
00:01:45,107 --> 00:01:46,900
-How pathetic.
-Chainsaw.

21
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:21,036
CHAINSAW MAN

22
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:35,634
The chainsaw retracted. I'm out of blood.

23
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:37,136
You lost.

24
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,138
-Die.
-Chainsaw.

25
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:51,900
Even blood as revolting as sewer water

26
00:03:51,984 --> 00:03:55,904
would taste like strawberry jam

27
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:59,575
when I see the agony on your face.

28
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,830
<i>The Devil Hunters that the Devils fear…</i>

29
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,170
are the ones who are nutcases.

30
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:17,843
Sahara was too sane.

31
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,179
That's why he died.

32
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,598
Kinochi was sane too.

33
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,349
And Subaru.

34
00:04:24,433 --> 00:04:26,226
And Sasaki.

35
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,022
A sane person would fear
the Devil's attacks.

36
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:32,774
And the fear makes the Devil stronger.

37
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:37,738
How is it working with that Aki kid?

38
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:39,990
He's a sane one too?

39
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:44,995
No sane person would try
to kill that Gun bastard.

40
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:49,750
You joined Public Safety
to kill Gun too, didn't you?

41
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,753
Are you messed up in the head?

42
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,380
No, I'm not.

43
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:56,965
Exactly.

44
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,383
You are no exception.

45
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:02,888
Most Devil Hunters dream of killing Gun.

46
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,974
All honest and simple people.

47
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:09,728
So the Devils know
how to make them afraid.

48
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,983
But there's no way of knowing
what a nutcase is thinking about.

49
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:18,779
Devils fear
what they can't understand too.

50
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,034
Master, you drink too much.

51
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:26,119
Stop. That's what a sane one would say.

52
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:28,830
It takes years of work to
loosen up a few screws.

53
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,756
Visiting your partners' graves
every month.

54
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,341
That only keeps them on tight.

55
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:41,969
I'll head back now.

56
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:44,888
Aki's still a rookie. Train him up.

57
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:47,683
I'll take my time.

58
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:49,935
You can't.

59
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,106
That kid's collecting pieces in earnest.

60
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:57,025
It won't be long before he finds Gun.

61
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:13,709
No.

62
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:17,045
No…

63
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:19,631
<i>No.</i>

64
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:21,591
Aki.

65
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,594
Wanna hop to the civilian side with me?

66
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,223
Someone gave me a generous offer.

67
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:31,226
We won't have to find Gun anymore.

68
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,562
We can grab lunch at places like this.

69
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:35,897
And watch a movie
after work once in a while.

70
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:37,816
That's not a bad way of living.

71
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,528
I can drink with you whenever you want.

72
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,948
But I'll never be a civilian Hunter.

73
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:46,783
I'm taking that almond tofu.

74
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,704
Give me a cigarette then.

75
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:02,966
<i>If Aki fights the Gun Devil,
he'll get killed for sure.</i>

76
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:06,595
<i>It's not because we aren't strong enough,</i>

77
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:09,973
<i>or because that Devil
can kill hundreds in a blink.</i>

78
00:07:11,558 --> 00:07:13,769
<i>It's because Aki is cool,</i>

79
00:07:13,852 --> 00:07:16,104
<i>serious, gentle…</i>

80
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,316
<i>and normal, like everyone else.</i>

81
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:21,568
<i>But…</i>

82
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:26,531
It hurts…

83
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,539
I…

84
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:35,832
I did it…

85
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,756
<i>If it's this guy…</i>

86
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,509
I just had a genius idea.

87
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,888
You get cut and bleed.

88
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:53,141
I drink your blood and recover.

89
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:57,270
Then there's a perpetual motion machine!

90
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,484
The Nobel Prize is mine!

91
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,907
<i>If it's this absolute nutjob,</i>

92
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:11,743
<i>he might actually be able to kill Gun.</i>

93
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,662
The pain…

94
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:41,189
Aki, are you still alive?

95
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:45,819
How long…

96
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,697
How long has it been?

97
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,409
Three days or so… after that.

98
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,078
Meowy…

99
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:58,248
Let's go have a drink.

100
00:08:59,207 --> 00:09:02,836
It's over. I want to sleep a bit.

101
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,172
It's over?

102
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:10,093
This is my weakness.

103
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,345
-This is my heart.
-Kill me.

104
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,930
-I'm sorry.
-I apologize.

105
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,140
-I can't take any more pain.
-It hurts.

106
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:17,726
Already?

107
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:22,230
But it feels so good,
like taking a dip in the pool.

108
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:34,785
We're out.

109
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,373
We got Gun Devil's piece.

110
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,708
And the weather is so good.

111
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,002
It feels like I just took a nice dump.

112
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,338
It feels like I'm floating…

113
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:52,803
He fell asleep…

114
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:56,139
He fought that Devil for days
without any sleep.

115
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,812
We'll take Aki and Denji to the hospital.

116
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:04,689
You two report back to the Sector.

117
00:10:12,823 --> 00:10:14,658
A newbie welcome party?

118
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,575
Yes.

119
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:18,662
Division 4 has
never gotten together before.

120
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:22,999
Let's bond as a team
and solve our latest problem.

121
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:24,501
Problem?

122
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:29,965
Thing is, Kobeni and Arai want to quit.

123
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,425
It's not just a fear of the Devils.

124
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,470
They probably regret now
that they tried to kill Denji.

125
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:38,849
You wanted him dead too, Himeno.

126
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:39,933
Yeah.

127
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:43,270
I can't believe kids nowadays
will quit over such petty things.

128
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:46,356
We should live shamelessly.

129
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,108
If it's at the drinking table,

130
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,443
we could apologize to Denji

131
00:10:50,527 --> 00:10:52,654
and persuade Kobeni and Arai to stay.

132
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,406
You just want to drink, don't you?

133
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,702
It's small, but I found a piece.

134
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:02,122
If we're going drinking,
it has to be this week.

135
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:03,999
Why?

136
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:07,002
I want to invite Ms. Makima.

137
00:11:14,384 --> 00:11:16,970
She's going to Kyoto
on a work trip next week.

138
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:19,055
I heard that she's going
there to request assistance

139
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,391
since Denji got targeted by a Devil.

140
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:23,310
So we should do it this week.

141
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:27,897
Seriously,

142
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,525
what do you think Denji is?

143
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,530
That Devil seemed to know
something about him.

144
00:11:36,031 --> 00:11:38,033
And I've never seen
anything like that form before.

145
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:42,787
The biggest question is why
Ms. Makima cares so much about him?

146
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:45,832
Ms. Makima…

147
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:49,002
Normally, she travels all the time.
But she's been staying in Tokyo lately.

148
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:50,545
That's because of Denji, right?

149
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:54,424
Could be because she knows his secret.

150
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:00,430
Should we get her drunk and make her talk?

151
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:04,434
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

152
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,811
The food smells so nice.

153
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,815
-Nice.
-So much food.

154
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,195
FUJIMOTO

155
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,364
Here I come.

156
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:18,865
-There's so many.
-Take it.

157
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:20,867
Which first?

158
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,243
Nice beer.

159
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:24,245
-I haven't drunk for half a year.
-It smells amazing.

160
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:26,748
Same here. Other than a little at home.

161
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,126
Get away. The sashimi is all mine.

162
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,629
What's this? Looks tasty.

163
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,384
Sorry, I got lost.

164
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,261
Kobeni, come sit here.

165
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:42,389
Ms. Makima said she'll be late.

166
00:12:44,224 --> 00:12:46,476
Three parfaits, and…

167
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:49,521
The Shiratama dumpling tray.
Three of those.

168
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:53,066
I've never had anything so delicious.

169
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,277
You send most of your salary home, right?

170
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,570
Eat up, okay?

171
00:12:57,654 --> 00:12:58,988
Hands off! Thief!

172
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,282
The fried chicken is all mine!

173
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,828
Fushi, you didn't bring your Fiend?

174
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:07,539
I didn't dare.

175
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:11,668
I'd love a more rational Fiend like yours.

176
00:13:11,751 --> 00:13:15,296
Hey! You're young! So order more!

177
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,591
The hell? I can't read most of this.

178
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,427
<i>KISU</i> TEMPURA

179
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:25,390
Hey, about my kiss…

180
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,812
I'm too shy to do it sober.

181
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:32,689
Wait till I get drunker.

182
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:37,610
I'll give you an intense one.

183
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:41,573
Forgive us for trying to kill you, okay?

184
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,284
Totally. Sure thing.

185
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:48,788
This is your welcome party, newbie.
Stand up and introduce yourself.

186
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,292
Your name, age, and the Devil
you have a contract with.

187
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:55,587
Don't say the Devil
you're contracted with in public.

188
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,215
You should only tell people you trust.

189
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,676
You're so boring, Aki.

190
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,221
It's okay.

191
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:07,390
I want to ask your hobby.

192
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:09,601
It says a lot about you as a person.

193
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:13,229
I'm Denji. I think I'm 16.

194
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:16,608
My hobbies are eating and sleeping.

195
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:18,735
No way. That's so young.

196
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,154
You're not drinking, are you?

197
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,614
This is tea.

198
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,909
I am Hirokazu Arai, 22 years old!

199
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:27,744
And I have a contract with the Fox Devil!

200
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:29,329
My hobby is haiku!

201
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,874
That's the same Devil
Mr. Hayakawa is contracted with.

202
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:35,919
The Fox Devil is very friendly
with humans.

203
00:14:36,002 --> 00:14:38,338
It has contracts with
a lot of Devil Hunters.

204
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:41,466
But only pretty people can use its head.

205
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,885
That Devil is very particular about looks.

206
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:48,473
I'm Kobeni Higashiyama. I'm 20…

207
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:51,726
The Devil I have a contract with is…
a secret.

208
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,395
My hobby is eating tasty food.

209
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,731
Her dress is so cute.

210
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:00,026
It's from my big sister.

211
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,780
-Eh? Where is your newbie, Fushi?
-Kobeni has eight sisters. That's crazy.

212
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:06,783
Unfortunately, they died yesterday.

213
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,286
I'm shoo shorry!

214
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,998
Resht… in… peesh…

215
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:16,042
You're already drunk.

216
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,796
They died so easily?

217
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,675
The Devils that civilian Hunters
can't handle get passed to Public Safety.

218
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,136
People die faster than you can count.

219
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:29,055
None of those people started
with me are here anymore.

220
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,309
Denji wants to kiss me, so he won't die.

221
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,689
Himeno always kisses around
when she's drunk.

222
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:42,360
Everyone except the newbies
has been kissed by her.

223
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,821
There's no escaping.

224
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:48,950
<i>My kiss is guaranteed.</i>

225
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:55,415
I'll get my first kiss today.

226
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,416
Kiss?

227
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,460
Ms. Makima.

228
00:15:59,544 --> 00:16:02,547
Excuse me. One beer, please.

229
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:05,258
Please sit here, Ms. Makima.

230
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,430
It's my first time seeing her in person.

231
00:16:12,348 --> 00:16:14,809
Denji, are you going to kiss someone?

232
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:15,810
I'm not!

233
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,189
Denji, you don't want the kiss anymore?

234
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,190
I do!

235
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,196
Excuse me. Another beer, please.

236
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:29,991
So what's this kiss about?

237
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:34,078
<i>I don't want Ms. Makima
to see me kissing Ms. Himeno.</i>

238
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,039
It's off the table?

239
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:40,210
<i>But I want a French kiss just as bad.</i>

240
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,213
<i>I need to change the subject for now.</i>

241
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,256
Ms. Makima, guess what?

242
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,967
I found one of those Gun Devil things.

243
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:51,471
I heard. Well done, Denji.

244
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:56,643
Devils with Gun's pieces are
appearing more frequently than ever.

245
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:59,354
And that Devil that just targeted Denji.

246
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:02,232
There's something fishy about all this.

247
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:05,735
Ms. Makima, do you know
something about Denji?

248
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:09,489
Give me that!

249
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:12,742
That's mine too!

250
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,831
I'll tell you if you can outdrink me.

251
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,503
Excuse me. Two beers, please.

252
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,383
I want to join. Another one for me.

253
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,510
Horse meat. Fried chicken. Horse meat.

254
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:31,552
Fried chicken!

255
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:38,726
That's mine!

256
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,479
Excuse me. Another one.

257
00:17:41,562 --> 00:17:43,856
By the way, you are impressive, Power.

258
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,610
Very few Fiends can suppress
their violent urges.

259
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:50,488
That's because I have a very high IQ!

260
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,366
Is that determined by IQ?

261
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:55,868
What is your IQ score?

262
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:56,869
A hundred?

263
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:01,541
Is that considered high?
I think mine's around 100 as well.

264
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,126
It's 120 then.

265
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,920
Fushi has a high IQ score, right?

266
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,672
Mine's 134.

267
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,508
That's specific.
You must be very proud of it.

268
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,637
I think mine's 500… or 1,000…

269
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:21,019
What's this?

270
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:28,276
<i>She saw me! Ms. Makima saw me!</i>

271
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,153
-<i>But… what's this?</i>
-They're kissing.

272
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:31,654
<i>This texture… Is it her tongue?</i>

273
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:33,281
<i>It's so good. So soft.</i>

274
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:35,074
<i>It's so soft! What is this?</i>

275
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:38,119
<i>Her tongue? It's melting in my mouth.</i>

276
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,038
<i>Tongue… No!</i>

277
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:42,040
<i>It's vomit!</i>

278
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,794
Now he's traumatized for life.

279
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:48,087
Oh, my.

280
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:50,798
Excuse me. Could we have
a rag or something?

281
00:18:50,882 --> 00:18:53,468
Oh, no. This is going to be bad.

282
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,682
Denji has a habit of swallowing
anything nutritious in his mouth.

283
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:06,147
Pochita.

284
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:07,982
This looks edible.

285
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:19,535
Pochita, look over there.

286
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:22,622
The rats are around some drunk's vomit.

287
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,291
They're eating it! Can you believe it?

288
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,919
Such a shame for mammals.

289
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,676
Himeno does need more self-control.

290
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,017
I'm good at helping sick people, right?

291
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:46,396
That's because my mom got drunk
after work all the time.

292
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,525
But I don't have your talent
as a Devil Hunter.

293
00:19:51,526 --> 00:19:52,944
I really envy you.

294
00:19:54,487 --> 00:19:56,447
You envy me?

295
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:58,157
Look at me.

296
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,743
My first kiss was with vomit.

297
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:02,703
Why would you envy--

298
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:14,882
I'll take them to Hayakawa's house.

299
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:17,468
-Arai, you take Himeno.
-I drank too much today.

300
00:20:17,552 --> 00:20:20,012
Ms. Makima paid for today.

301
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,597
Thank her, everyone.

302
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:25,059
Drinks paid by others are
the best drinks you can get.

303
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:25,977
Yeah.

304
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,857
Hey, where is Denji?

305
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,819
Himeno just carried him off.

306
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,326
So dark…

307
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,036
Where am I?

308
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,249
Water…

309
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:52,044
Oh, that vomit lady.

310
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,796
She kissed me with vomit.

311
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,257
Damn it.

312
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,885
Water…

313
00:21:17,278 --> 00:21:20,615
What's this? Denji.

314
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,201
Why are you at my place?

315
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:28,748
Did I bring you here?

316
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,794
I feel dizzy. What the hell?

317
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:42,220
Oh right. You like Ms. Makima, don't you?

318
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:45,723
My head's spinning.

319
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:49,101
You shouldn't like her.

320
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:52,355
Jeez, Aki too.

321
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:54,774
Why does he have to act so shy?

322
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,443
Boo… Moo…

323
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:58,611
Cow.

324
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:24,470
Let's do it.

325
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,811
CHAINSAW MAN
