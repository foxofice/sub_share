1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,430
I can see it.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:09,980
That's fine.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,320
I can dodge them if I'm careful.

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,240
With no contact,
I can neutralize his weapons.

5
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,300
-That's it, kid!
-You can do it!

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,050
-That kid can really fight.
-He landed a strike on the commander!

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,850
The swift like him are tenacious!

8
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,640
It's been a while
since we saw a good fight!

9
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,560
Damn it, I can't cut him.

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,060
-He's wearing chain mail.
-I liked this tunic.

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,990
My axes don't seem to scare you much.

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,200
You have real courage.

13
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,450
You definitely got that from Thors.

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,660
You giant bastard.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,950
How do you know my father?

16
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,880
Didn't he tell you anything?

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,590
How inconsiderate of him.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,130
I heard he originally
came from nobility, a jarl.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,220
That was Helga's side.

20
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,850
Thors gained rank
by his own swordsmanship.

21
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,100
What?

22
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,390
Do you wanna learn more?

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,600
Do you?

24
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,150
If you want to learn more,
you'll have to entertain me a bit more.

25
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,360
All right, Thorfinn?

26
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,030
I can entertain you,

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,910
but when I'm done,
your mouth might not work so well.

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,710
Well said, kid!

29
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,800
That's sidesplitting.

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,380
When he's done!?

31
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,050
Yeah kid, go easy on him!

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,050
What a moron!

33
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,350
Is something funny?

34
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,440
Thorfinn is a worthy opponent.

35
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,520
Do not laugh at him.

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,030
Thors was stronger than me.

37
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,950
Show me
that you are truly the son of Thors,

38
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,160
Thorfinn!

39
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,430
That stupid child.

40
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,010
He came to get killed.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,940
What happened to the prince?

42
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,150
Take that side!

43
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,150
Take out his legs!

44
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,650
From that direction!

45
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,700
Close by,

46
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,200
I can hear the cries of war.

47
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,580
I wish they would stop.

48
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,830
Have they nothing better to do?

49
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,040
Please be quiet.

50
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,960
I don't want to open my eyes.

51
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,460
I want to stay asleep.

52
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,760
Just like this.

53
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,430
Forever.

54
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,140
Your Highness.

55
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,850
Your Highness, Prince Canute.

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Ragnar!

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,450
You're alive!

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,340
This is

59
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,000
just a dream.

60
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,420
Ragnar.

61
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,090
Yes.

62
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,890
I have come to say my goodbye.

63
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,100
Will you leave

64
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,440
without me?

65
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,610
Are you saying…

66
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,320
I must live in this world alone?

67
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,360
How am I to continue?

68
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,750
I have…

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,500
I have failed you

70
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,790
in your education.

71
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,420
I treated you not as a jarl,

72
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,300
but as a normal child.

73
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,390
I raised you

74
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,310
as a farmer would raise his own child.

75
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,020
I did this against His Majesty's wishes.

76
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,440
Please forgive me.

77
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,860
How is that wrong?!

78
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,160
You gave me more than
my own father, the king!

79
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,870
I didn't want to be born into royalty.

80
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,340
If only…

81
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,510
If only

82
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,300
I had been born as your son,

83
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,350
things would have been so much better.

84
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,100
Your Highness.

85
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,980
Hearing that brings me joy, Your Highness.

86
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,940
Don't go.

87
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,780
I love you.

88
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,000
There are things
you only understand after losing them.

89
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,210
You have already realized it.

90
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,470
-Ragnar.
-I am only in your dreams.

91
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,720
-Wait.
-The time has come for you to awaken.

92
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,140
No, Ragnar.

93
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,220
Come back.

94
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,480
Come back!

95
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,980
Live well, Your Highness.

96
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,160
Ragnar.

97
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,550
Do not falter!
We can take him together!

98
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,150
How are you injuries?

99
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,320
Those men are fighting
over who will take possession of you.

100
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,910
You have become a prize to be won.

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,910
As a monk,
can you not stop their fighting?

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,830
Is there a way to stop them?

103
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,420
If they wish to die,
then we should let them.

104
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,760
I had a dream.

105
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,600
I dreamt of Ragnar.

106
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,520
He was able to say goodbye.

107
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,570
He's a sincere man, even in death.

108
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,820
The only person who loved me

109
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,780
has now departed from this world.

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,210
That is a great enlightenment.

111
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,380
But not entirely true.

112
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,630
Was it love that Ragnar felt for you?

113
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,430
For your safety,

114
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,390
he witnessed
the murder of 62 good villagers.

115
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Your Highness,

116
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,730
what is

117
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,270
love?

118
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,740
Man, these guys hardly put up a fight.

119
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,660
It's hard to find strong opponents.

120
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
We'll never reach Valhalla at this rate.

121
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,330
Is the commander still dueling?

122
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,420
No way. That kid's dead.

123
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,590
Then why are they shouting?

124
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,010
I'm gonna take a look!

125
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,920
Me, too!

126
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,630
Hey, what's going on?

127
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
-Get him!
-Commander!

128
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,140
-Damn kid!
-Don't run away!

129
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,440
Seriously?

130
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,450
The commander…

131
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,570
That kid is ripping him apart!

132
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,200
That's it, Thorfinn.

133
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,710
There are maybe five men under me
who could take you on.

134
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,170
He's wearing
the same chain mail as before.

135
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,300
I must hit his tendons.

136
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,470
When I went for his vital in London
he caused me pain.

137
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,720
The only way to win this
is to stop his mobility.

138
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,020
Although you're certainly strong,

139
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,270
I feel like your skill
with the daggers is but average.

140
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,150
There is something missing
that would complete you as a warrior.

141
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,370
In that case, how did you get so cut up?

142
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,870
This is true.

143
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,540
I'm missing something too.

144
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,000
I was hoping I could learn it from you,
son of Thors.

145
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,170
Tell me, Thorfinn.

146
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,460
What do you think?

147
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,550
What does it mean to be

148
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,470
a true warrior?

149
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,270
You're asking what love is?

150
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,110
Are you saying that Ragnar didn't love me?

151
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,820
Yes.

152
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,620
Then I have a question for you.

153
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,370
If Ragnar didn't love me,

154
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,210
then who is the person
who properly embodies love?

155
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,340
There's one over there.

156
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,260
See?

157
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,680
He has died

158
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,350
and has become more beautiful
than any living being.

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,690
You can call that true love.

160
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:42,230
He can

161
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,150
no longer

162
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,150
hate or steal.

163
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,160
He will remain abandoned here,

164
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,540
and his flesh will provide generously
for the beasts and the insects.

165
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,540
He'll be exposed to the wind and the rain

166
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,170
without uttering a word of complaint.

167
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,010
Death…

168
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,130
completes the human being.

169
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,390
Hey! What's wrong?

170
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,440
Damn it!

171
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,070
You don't know?

172
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,200
Well, don't worry about it.
I didn't expect you to.

173
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,370
That's a cheap trick!

174
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,500
That's true love?

175
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
Death?

176
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,090
Yes.

177
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,420
In that case, what would you call
those precious feelings

178
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,300
between parents and children,
husband and wife, and Ragnar and me?

179
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,720
Discrimination.

180
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,230
Flattering kings while whipping slaves
is not so different from that.

181
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,570
To Ragnar, Your Highness
was more precious than anyone else.

182
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:15,490
He perhaps treasured you
more than his own life.

183
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,990
That

184
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,120
fondness which he so expressed for you

185
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,500
was discrimination.

186
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
I see.

187
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,550
I understand now.

188
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,180
It feels like

189
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,900
a fog has lifted.

190
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,070
What?

191
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,110
Come on!

192
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,410
I can't believe it!

193
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,500
Ouch.

194
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,000
Damn it. It's still too shallow!

195
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,720
I understand.

196
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,890
This snow…

197
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,260
is love, isn't it?

198
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,180
That's right.

199
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,110
The sky.

200
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,690
The sun.

201
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,110
The blowing wind.

202
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,070
The trees.

203
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,110
The mountains.

204
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,250
Yet.

205
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,710
It's unbelievable.

206
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,960
The world…

207
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,050
God's work is so beautiful, and yet…

208
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,600
inside the hearts of men…

209
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,600
love does not exist?

210
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,700
It is said that the reason
we live this way

211
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,570
is because our ancestors
long ago disobeyed God

212
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,490
and by choice committed

213
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,830
the original sin.

214
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,330
After that, we were

215
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,250
banished from paradise.

216
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,480
-What?
-Hey!

217
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,350
-Where'd he go?
-What?

218
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,100
-Hey!
-Is that…

219
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,030
He sprung off my foot
to soften the blow?

220
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,110
Not bad.

221
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,000
-Over there!
-Incredible!

222
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,000
He's dead now!

223
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,500
That's our commander!

224
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,130
Damn it.

225
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,260
Have I finally run out of options?

226
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,830
I think they're done fighting.

227
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,290
However,

228
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,170
this isn't good.

229
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,290
He may have lost his sanity.

230
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,170
Your Highness,
you should make your escape.

231
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,350
Sanity?

232
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,480
Where are the sane people in this world?

233
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,070
They're all the same.

234
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
All the same.

235
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,030
All are the same
without the knowledge of love.

236
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,200
They don't know the meaning of life,
the meaning of death,

237
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,410
or even the meaning of their fighting.

238
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,250
Your Highness…

239
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,630
Enough.

240
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,840
I am tired of this.

241
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,990
Something was lost in exchange for wisdom.

242
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,320
A most important thing.

243
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,160
That something…

244
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,700
we will never attain as long as we live.

245
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,290
We will never attain it.

246
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,590
But despite that,

247
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,720
we are still asked to pursue it?

248
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,510
Father in Heaven!

249
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,020
Miserable warrior,

250
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,150
you are the furthest away from love.

251
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,610
You were exiled from paradise.

252
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,420
To end the suffering of your punishment,
is there no other option but to die?

253
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,220
Is our only option in life
to be tested and to endure?

254
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,590
Father in Heaven!

255
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,390
By your trials,
this man's soul cannot be saved!

256
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
Father,

257
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,630
I will no longer seek your salvation.

258
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,670
If you will not give it to us,

259
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,550
then by our own will

260
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,550
we will create
another paradise from this land.

261
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,270
What? Prince?

262
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,770
The pain!

263
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,650
Prince! Are you okay?

264
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,900
Stop, you fools.

265
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,910
Stop your meaningless quarrel.

266
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,490
Meaningless?

267
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,960
The wound is severe.

268
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,910
Are you okay?

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,620
Damn it.

270
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,170
I made a mistake.

271
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,630
Don't move.

272
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,340
Your stomach has been cut.

273
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,550
Willibald!

274
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,840
Treat his wounds.

275
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,050
I will gather the horses.

276
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,850
You there, with me.

277
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,020
Your Highness.

278
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,020
I have witnessed a miracle.

279
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,310
Shut up and treat him.

280
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,940
Wait a minute, Prince!

281
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,690
Where are you going?

282
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,450
I'm taking you to Thorkell.

283
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,530
If I don't, my comrades will…

284
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,450
I am going to Thorkell myself.

285
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,200
We cannot transport the injured
without borrowing a sled from them.

286
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,710
You cannot do that!

287
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,590
Why do you think
I'm in tatters, you idiot?

288
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,300
If you go to Thorkell,
all this will have no meaning.

289
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Meaning? Meaning, you say?

290
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,890
A meaning to your fighting?

291
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,850
There is no meaning to this battle.

292
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,360
So don't die.

293
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,030
You warriors will become my vassals.

294
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,410
From now on,
I will tell you when to fight.

295
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,960
I will give meaning to your battles,
your lives, and your deaths.

296
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,960
That is

297
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,300
the duty of a king.

298
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
