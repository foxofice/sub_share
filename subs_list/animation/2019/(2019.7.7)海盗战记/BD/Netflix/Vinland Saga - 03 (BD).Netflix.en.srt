EPISODE 3: TROLL

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,890
There are no major changes.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,060
Compensation is five pounds of gold.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,400
You won't be paid
until you produce the body.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,780
You may do what you wish
with his ships and cargo.

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,950
Kill Thors.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,910
-Come on! I told you, monk!
-I'm next!

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,540
Thors, eh?

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,670
The Troll of Jom.

10
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,630
I've heard of him. But are you sure?
Is he not a hero in your land?

11
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,050
I wouldn't ask you to kill him
if he was a hero.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:45,390
He broke a military law.
Desertion in the face of the enemy.

13
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,810
The order for his execution
has stood for 15 years.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,320
I know you're one for upholding the law
but, my God, 15 years?

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,280
You took your time.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,780
But, I mean,

17
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,750
as long as I'm paid properly,
I'll take any job given to me.

18
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,120
But you know,

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,960
when you're executing one of your own,
I thought normally you'd do it yourself.

20
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,720
You went to Iceland, didn't you?

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,640
Why didn't you kill him then?

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,970
The Christian monk's already dead.

23
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,270
That's not your concern.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,190
For your own sake,
keep your nose out of it.

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,780
Fine by me.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,200
Give me five more pounds of gold
in advance and I'll take the job.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,710
It's bold of you
to ask for that so casually.

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,340
Oh, no! Sorry about that.

29
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,180
It just slipped out of my hand.
No one's hurt, right?

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,520
You must be more careful!

31
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,020
You could have hit me!

32
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,190
-You're awful at it!
-You're drinking too much, Bjorn!

33
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,610
Another five pounds of gold in advance.

34
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,320
Then we'll do it.

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,330
Fine.

36
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,580
You're as manly as I expected.
I'll see you later then.

37
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,170
By the way.

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,050
What kind of warrior is this Thors?

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,590
How does he look?

40
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,300
How does he fight?

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,180
Thors is no longer a warrior.

42
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,940
All right, drinking game is over.
Time to get to work, you rogues.

43
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,150
Bjorn, that was a good throw.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
No sweat.

45
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,410
Even caught Floki off guard.

46
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,280
I wish I could have seen his face.

47
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Seems he's not just idle talk.

48
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,980
For me, Ari, son of Geitr,
the time has come to become a man.

49
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,360
I know. Don't say a word.
Of course, it won't be an easy journey.

50
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,740
And it is possible
I'll be injured on the field of battle.

51
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,070
But I shall return home!

52
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,990
And when I do, I will present you
with a necklace plundered from England!

53
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,710
-I'm still sleepy.
-Now, if you would…

54
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,620
m… ma… marr…

55
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,710
-Marry--
-Ari!

56
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,710
Your lunch. You forgot your lunch.

57
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,630
Mother!

58
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,600
Why are you so careless? Be sure to share
the salted herring with the others.

59
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,850
-I made a lot.
-Move it, Mother.

60
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,350
How dare you speak to me that way!

61
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll talk to you when I return.
Wait for me, Ylva!

62
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,990
They're leaving today.

63
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,700
I hope they don't die.

64
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,490
Ylva.

65
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,330
Could I have a word?

66
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,870
Wait, I'm first!

67
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,370
Hey, Ylva!

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,500
Maybe try somewhere else?

69
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,380
Don't forget to wash properly
every Saturday, dear?

70
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,640
Yes, Mama.

71
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,220
I swear on the axe of my ancestors
to bring back a chest of gold coins!

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,600
The young men are in high spirits!

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,440
But are only five men really enough?

74
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,860
Thors said that five was enough.

75
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,070
Well, if he says so,
then it must be right.

76
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,740
But five men
are barely enough to sail the ship.

77
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,910
But if that's what he decided,
he must have a good reason.

78
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,620
What were you talking about with Ylva?

79
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,670
Shut up, you dope.
I could ask you the same thing.

80
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,710
You better watch your back
on the battlefield.

81
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,550
Don't mock me.
I could say the same to you.

82
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,470
Ari!

83
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,590
What?

84
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,310
Be careful out there.

85
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,310
Yeah.

86
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,230
-We're not done here.
-What did you say?

87
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,860
Don't walk in front of me!

88
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,110
Miss.

89
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,650
Are you worried about Ari?

90
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,200
Then let me tell you a secret.

91
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,660
What? They're not going off to war?

92
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,540
It's a secret.

93
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,670
On our way to Jomsborg,
we'll stop in Norway.

94
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,670
There, Thors plans
to leave those boys behind.

95
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,560
With new sailors from Norway,
Thors will set off to Jomsborg.

96
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,310
I'm a friend of the former king of Norway.

97
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:47,690
I've got some influence there.

98
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,770
And as soon as I'm done trading,
I'll bring those boys home.

99
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,320
I can only carry about five men
on my rotting old boat.

100
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,700
Thors won't take
a single one of them into battle.

101
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,290
That's the kind of man Thors is.

102
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,210
Thorfinn!

103
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,510
Hey! Where are you?

104
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,930
Thorfinn!

105
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,390
But Leif.

106
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,100
Does that mean
Thors will go to battle alone?

107
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,610
Ready to sail!

108
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Ready!

109
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,460
What's with that oar?

110
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,830
That Thorfinn.
How could he not see Father off?

111
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,340
Is he still holding a grudge
about last night?

112
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,760
-Helga!
-Yes?

113
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,390
Tell Thorfinn for me…

114
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,470
that… well…

115
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,270
I mean…

116
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,650
Yes. I will tell him.

117
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,150
Thank you.

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,660
All right. Depart!

119
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,790
What monstrous strength.

120
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,460
Idiot! Don't stop rowing!

121
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,960
Paddle!

122
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,470
Good luck!

123
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,970
Bring back trophies!

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
Open the sail!

125
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,040
-The skin on my hands is raw.
-Oh, my butt!

126
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,040
Hang in there.

127
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,500
Ari, man the rudder.

128
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,300
Mord and Magni, adjust the buntlines.
Hakon and Grim, do the braces.

129
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,760
Are you tired?

130
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,890
No, not at all…

131
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,520
Don't worry.
There's not much rowing from here.

132
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,190
We're in the current,
so it'll move on its own.

133
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,520
Does that mean we can't turn back, Father?

134
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,230
You could say that.

135
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,950
"Father"?

136
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,830
Tho--

137
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,990
Thorfinn! You--

138
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,250
Not now!

139
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,920
Made it.

140
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,770
You sneaky little--

141
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,890
Father!

142
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
The sea!

143
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,660
There's something suspicious about this.

144
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,870
What's that?

145
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,540
That Floki is hiding many things.

146
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,840
What he said
about Thors's execution must be a lie.

147
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,130
I'm sure of it.

148
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,590
Then what is this?

149
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,180
An assassination.

150
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,890
I don't know if it's personal,
but he decided this on his own.

151
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,520
So what?

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,940
We still get paid if we kill him.

153
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,650
Why do you think
he didn't use his own men?

154
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,240
So he's not caught violating orders?

155
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,780
Well, that's part of it.

156
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,660
But perhaps he's afraid
of what he might lose.

157
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,660
A loss so great,
he can't explain it to his leader.

158
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,960
Like losing an entire Jomsvikings crew?

159
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,000
To get one old warrior?

160
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,710
That's ridiculous.

161
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,890
Get down here, you brat!

162
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,430
Suddenly, I want
to see this Troll of Jom for myself.

163
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm glad that he'll provide
some excitement.

164
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,380
I can't see any stars.
I can't see anything.

165
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,090
Which way are we going?

166
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,050
Thors!

167
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,340
The wind has changed!
A little to the right.

168
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,300
I will take the lead. Follow behind me.

169
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,640
All right!

170
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,610
Wow.

171
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,110
How is Leif able to navigate the sea
without getting lost?

172
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,370
Ari.

173
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,120
Don't stare long into the night sea.

174
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,370
It will drag you under.

175
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,220
Thors.

176
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,140
What's the battlefield like?

177
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,430
You've fought all over, haven't you?

178
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,560
Tell me some of your great stories.

179
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,150
I want to take down an enemy leader
and become a man too!

180
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,150
I see.

181
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,740
My daughter certainly prefers strong men.

182
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,870
It'll be tough for you too.

183
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,160
You got me. You saw right through me.

184
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,750
Do you like Ylva, Ari?

185
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,170
Yeah, she's my type. She's cute.

186
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,380
She was born
when I was still a Jomsviking.

187
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,140
She's my first child.

188
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,520
She's noisy.

189
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,900
Do all babies cry this much?

190
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,280
Thors, you mustn't hold her like that!

191
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,820
Support her head!

192
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,910
Give me a boy next time, Helga.

193
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,330
The leader wishes for a boy.

194
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,630
My wife Helga is the daughter
of the army leader.

195
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,210
Her face was pale after a difficult labor.

196
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
Thors.

197
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,180
Give her a name.

198
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,600
Name her what you like.

199
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,140
I'm busy.

200
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,520
The Norway campaign is soon.

201
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,100
Thors, the ships are leaving.

202
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,390
Good. I'll go now.

203
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,810
Thors!

204
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,240
Give her a name.

205
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,240
In the 15 years we've been together,

206
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,830
Helga has only been angry that one time.

207
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,840
Ylva was the name of my mother.

208
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,380
It just came to me.

209
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,090
Now that I think about it,
that's when it started.

210
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:02,600
That's when I began
to fear the battlefield.

211
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,190
That is why I fled.

212
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,610
The warriors who knew me then
may speak ill of me now.

213
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,820
Hey! I can see the Faroe Islands!

214
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,760
Father!

215
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,010
Is this England?

216
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,270
We're in England?

217
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,020
You're completely wrong!

218
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,270
These are the Faroe Islands.

219
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,270
They're right between Iceland and Norway.

220
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,280
We'll rest here
to make the journey easier.

221
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,280
There's a village in that fjord up ahead.

222
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,070
We'll get drinking water there
and I can sell my goods.

223
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,870
By the way, are you planning to come
all the way to England with us?

224
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,500
Get ready to row!

225
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,300
All right, do your best!

226
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,680
I wish we didn't have to do this.

227
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,810
My butt hurts!

228
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,490
What's wrong, Leif?

229
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,200
Something's wrong.

230
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,360
What is it?

231
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,780
That's what I'm wondering.

232
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,950
Something different from last time.

233
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,010
I know. It's the number of houses.
There are fewer.

234
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,850
Let's turn back, Leif.
I have a bad feeling about this.

235
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,060
The terrain's bad too.

236
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
-What?
-Are you serious?

237
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,060
Hey, they're rowing backwards.

238
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,520
Did they notice us?

239
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,400
Not bad.

240
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,030
They're careful.
They may prove to be formidable.

241
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,780
They're too close, but it can't be helped.

242
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,530
The ships will be slightly damaged,
but do it!

243
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,650
The fjord entrance is blocked!

244
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,820
Take that!

245
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,410
All right, excellent!
They're just rats in a trap.

246
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,580
Thors! Everyone! Are you hurt?

247
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,080
Everyone safe?

248
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,580
-Yes!
-More or less.

249
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,460
Arrows will fall. Protect your heads!

250
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Leif, what's your damage?

251
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,970
We're good.
No damage to the ship or the crew.

252
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,220
They're coming.

253
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,470
The person who set this trap
is further up the fjord.

254
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,480
Further up?

255
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,120
Pirates?

256
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,880
These are house pillars.

257
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,090
We're completely blocked in.

258
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,510
They got us.

259
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,350
They'll spare us if we surrender.

260
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,600
You don't know that!

261
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,100
Of course not!

262
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:18,270
If we're caught, we'll just be sold
as slaves. Brace yourselves!

263
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,020
No big deal.

264
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,030
There are only two ships.

265
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,400
Put it away, Ari.

266
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,530
They're skilled fighters.

267
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,410
Farmers are no match for roaming pirates.

268
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,740
You don't stand a chance against them.

269
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,160
Father.

270
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,130
Thors?

271
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,320
Thorfinn.

272
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,570
Only use this to protect yourself.

273
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,320
Do you hear me? Only as a last resort.

274
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,540
You're going to kill them after all?

275
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,840
You are, aren't you?

276
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,090
All right! Let's kill them!

277
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,090
Don't say "kill" so easily.

278
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,230
Bjorn! That mushroom…

279
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:46,570
One, two, three…
Eleven, twelve… and one kid.

280
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,240
What? That's all?

281
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,490
Hey, Askeladd!

282
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Could you let me handle this alone?

283
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,160
It'll be no fun
if we all go against so few.

284
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,750
I'll find out what kind of man
this Troll of Jom is.

285
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Go ahead. It seems he wishes for the same.

286
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,390
Bastard!

287
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,270
What's with you?

288
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,730
Where did you fall from?

289
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,190
Brother!

290
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:28,690
Let's kill him.

291
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,460
Not bad.

292
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,760
Troll of Jom.

293
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
