1
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,789
Time to work.

2
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,106
Sixty thousand a month
for chopping trees down.

3
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:25,320
The kidney I sold is worth 1.2 million.

4
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:29,532
The right eye is worth 300,000.

5
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:32,785
And one testicle…

6
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,704
How much did I get?

7
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,248
Was it less than 100,000?

8
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,921
So the remaining debt is…

9
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,924
Thirty-eight million forty thousand yen.

10
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:52,639
Okay, Pochita.

11
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,807
Let's kill it.

12
00:01:56,017 --> 00:01:58,061
I'll get paid about 300,000

13
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:00,355
for every devil I kill.

14
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:07,362
Be a Devil Hunter
if you want to make big money.

15
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:43,750
CHAINSAW MAN

16
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:54,844
This thing is a tomato devil.

17
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,264
It resurrects from the seeds.
Remember to burn it.

18
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:01,059
Well done, Denji.

19
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,521
Its corpse can earn us
a fortune in the black market.

20
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:07,190
Your bounty is 400,000.

21
00:04:07,774 --> 00:04:08,608
Thanks.

22
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,778
That's 170,000,
after paying your debt and interest.

23
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:14,947
And after deducting
the agency fee, service charge,

24
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:19,202
and management costs…

25
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,704
Only 70,000 left…

26
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:25,291
And I have to pay the water bills

27
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,961
and some other debts.

28
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,963
Unbelievable.

29
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:34,050
Now there's only 1,800 yen left.

30
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,178
No food at home.

31
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,515
I'll have to survive this month
with the money I have.

32
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:42,892
Pochita.

33
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,228
We only have a piece of toast for today.

34
00:04:51,776 --> 00:04:55,113
Why would you hire
that brat to hunt devils?

35
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:59,325
He owes us a huge debt.

36
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:02,995
To be exact, his dead dad did.

37
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:07,375
Is someone feeding a devil
really a good fit for the job?

38
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,628
A licensed Devil Hunter

39
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:14,882
will never leave a devil's corpse to us.

40
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,387
And a good thing about Denji
is that he won't fight back.

41
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,102
Hey, dog.

42
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:30,022
Eat this cigarette
and I'll give you 100 yen.

43
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:34,277
Really?

44
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,611
I'm doing it then.

45
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:46,914
I'll call you when there's another devil.
If you dare run away, I'll kill you.

46
00:06:03,347 --> 00:06:05,183
Now we won't have to worry about food
for the next three days.

47
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,563
I heard

48
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:14,066
that people spread jam
on the toast before they eat it.

49
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,654
But a normal person's life is
something we can only dream of.

50
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:22,825
I probably can never pay off
all the debts.

51
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:29,916
And I most likely will never
have a woman to date before I die.

52
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,963
I can't ask them to come to this pigsty
and I don't have money for dates.

53
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:42,803
If my dream can come true,

54
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,723
I want to hug a woman before I die.

55
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:05,409
Kill yourself if you can't pay
the debt for this month.

56
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:09,789
Brat, go beg, solicit, or whatever.

57
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:12,458
Just get me 700,000 before tomorrow.

58
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:16,337
Or you'll have to pay with your corpse.

59
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,478
Chain… Chainsaw…

60
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:38,234
It's a devil.

61
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:42,321
If you want to kill me, make it quick.

62
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,323
I'm going to die anyway.

63
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:54,166
You're hurt.

64
00:07:55,668 --> 00:07:57,670
Are you dying too?

65
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:05,094
Bite me.

66
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:08,973
I heard that devils cure themselves
by drinking blood.

67
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,142
Bite me if you want to live.

68
00:08:23,988 --> 00:08:25,740
But my blood is not for free.

69
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,992
This is a contract.

70
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,244
I help you now,

71
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:32,330
and you have to help me too.

72
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,461
So I don't really want to die.

73
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:55,603
How about hiring me as a Devil Hunter?

74
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:05,529
My empty stomach is keeping me awake.

75
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:09,742
I think of the debts when I can't sleep,
and that sobers me up even more.

76
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,915
I've decided what dreams I want today.

77
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,794
I'll eat lots of toast with jam
along with Pochita.

78
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,296
I'll flirt with a woman

79
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,382
and play video games with her.

80
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:26,300
And she'll cuddle me to sleep.

81
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:28,552
Nice, isn't it?

82
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:49,907
My mom died coughing blood
as a result of a heart disease.

83
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:56,997
Denji, there's a devil. Time to work.

84
00:10:15,641 --> 00:10:19,395
<i>At least let me dream.</i>

85
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:47,798
Can a devil appear in such a place?

86
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,305
I don't see it.

87
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:56,640
Is it hiding somewhere?

88
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,561
Or has it left?

89
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:17,578
Denji, we are grateful for your work.

90
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:19,747
Oh, okay.

91
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,832
You obeyed every order like a dog.

92
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:25,920
You did everything we asked
for only a few nickels like a dog.

93
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:27,338
Right…

94
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:30,966
But a dog stinks and it disgusts me.

95
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:46,065
We scamps also…

96
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,069
want to be stronger and make more money.

97
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:54,740
So we decided to sign contracts
with devils, just like you did.

98
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:00,955
We want the devil's power.

99
00:12:01,956 --> 00:12:06,460
I want the Devil Hunters… to die.

100
00:12:08,212 --> 00:12:10,714
Devil Hunter.

101
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,260
Seriously, these guys are
so stupid and gullible.

102
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:17,513
I said I'd give them the devil's power,

103
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:21,267
and they volunteered to be my slaves.

104
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,770
Unfortunately, they became zombies
because of that power.

105
00:12:24,853 --> 00:12:27,273
That's because I'm a zombie devil.

106
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,027
Devil Hunters want to kill us.
They are the worst.

107
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,530
So I have to exterminate them.

108
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,120
Everyone, tear him into pieces
and throw him into the garbage.

109
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:43,289
Dammit.

110
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,180
The exit…

111
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:18,157
Dammit. Let me go!

112
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:33,589
<i>I never wanted to be rich.</i>

113
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:37,968
<i>I just want to live a normal life.</i>

114
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,556
<i>Is that too much to ask?</i>

115
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,641
Pochita…

116
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:29,311
Pochita, time to work.

117
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,200
Pochita.

118
00:14:43,784 --> 00:14:46,870
I might get killed
while fighting the devils.

119
00:14:47,538 --> 00:14:50,791
The only concern I have is Pochita.

120
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:54,211
You might starve to death

121
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,548
or get killed by other Devil Hunters.

122
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:06,348
It's said that some devils
can inhabit a human corpse.

123
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:09,309
If you have that kind of power,

124
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,646
I want to give you my body.

125
00:15:14,356 --> 00:15:18,110
<i>This way, you won't get
chased around after I die.</i>

126
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:21,613
<i>So you can leave this town.</i>

127
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,115
And then…

128
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:27,786
I hope you can live like a normal person,

129
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,788
and die like a normal person.

130
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:36,128
Can you realize my dream for me?

131
00:16:04,406 --> 00:16:05,324
Pochita.

132
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,080
Did you successfully take my body?

133
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:17,836
I like hearing Denji
talking about his dreams.

134
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,632
This is a contract.

135
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:23,967
I give you my heart.

136
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:25,636
And in exchange…

137
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,847
Let me see your dreams, Denji.

138
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,307
Pochita.

139
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:37,773
The wounds are gone.

140
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:45,864
Pochita…

141
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,124
What the hell?

142
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,876
How can you still be alive
after being cut into pieces?

143
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,628
Why? Disgusting.

144
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,631
I hate Devil Hunters.

145
00:17:02,714 --> 00:17:05,759
Everyone, go eat him.

146
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,893
<i>These people were
already living a rich life.</i>

147
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:17,146
<i>Why did they still want more?</i>

148
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:19,648
<i>But I'm just the same.</i>

149
00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:23,652
<i>I was happy with Pochita,
but I wasn't satisfied.</i>

150
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:26,905
<i>I wanted a better life.</i>

151
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:31,660
<i>Is that so? Everybody dreams.</i>

152
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,788
<i>Then it's not a bad thing.</i>

153
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:38,417
It's not a bad thing…

154
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,754
but if you dare attempt to stop us,

155
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:46,925
you die!

156
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:58,937
They devoured his body.
Now he should be dead.

157
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:32,846
How did you…

158
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,850
That little devil took your body?

159
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:39,102
Then we should be the same.

160
00:19:00,165 --> 00:19:01,917
That hurt.

161
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,394
Don't come close.

162
00:19:25,274 --> 00:19:26,483
Get out of my way!

163
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:30,654
Don't come here…

164
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,989
Don't come close!

165
00:19:32,072 --> 00:19:33,991
I told you not to come!

166
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,965
Die!

167
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,669
So you all

168
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,173
have become devils even in your heart.

169
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:35,344
Since I was hired as a Devil Hunter,

170
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:39,598
I should kill every last devil.

171
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:46,146
Yes.

172
00:20:46,229 --> 00:20:49,524
As long as I kill every one of you,

173
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:51,276
there will be no more debt!

174
00:21:38,615 --> 00:21:40,492
Someone did the job for us.

175
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:51,086
There's one left.

176
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,229
You have a strange smell.

177
00:22:10,313 --> 00:22:12,566
Neither human nor devil.

178
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,737
Did you do this?

179
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:24,161
L-Let me hug you…

180
00:22:43,722 --> 00:22:44,723
It's a human.

181
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,475
Maybe a devil took his body.

182
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,229
No, his face is enough to tell.

183
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:59,321
We are Devil Hunters from the police.
We are here to kill the zombie devil.

184
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:05,994
You have two options.

185
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:09,664
Either to get killed by me as a devil,

186
00:23:10,874 --> 00:23:13,293
or to get fed by me as a human.

187
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,255
I'll feed you three times a day
if the latter.

188
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:30,769
Feed… Then what's for breakfast?

189
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,399
Toast with butter and jam.

190
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:42,280
Salad, coffee… Maybe a dessert.

191
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:44,783
What?

192
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,667
Isn't that just wonderful?
