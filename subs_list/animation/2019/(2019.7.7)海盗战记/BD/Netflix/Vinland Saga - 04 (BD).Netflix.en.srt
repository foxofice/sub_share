EPISODE 4: A TRUE WARRIOR

2
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,580
Don't get cocky!

3
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,220
What is he?

4
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,910
Here he comes!

5
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,030
What do we do, Bjorn?

6
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,820
Oh, no! Bjorn is on a rampage!

7
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,910
Stop him! The boat can't take it!

8
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,160
You're asking for the impossible!

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,910
How are we to stop that monster?

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,790
Run! No one can stop him!

11
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,380
He ate a berserker mushroom.

12
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,710
All that with his bare fists.
He's more than a mere monster.

13
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,840
The Troll… of Jom.

14
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,930
Just one ship to go.

15
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,280
Here… they come.

16
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,610
-What should we do?
-Surrender?

17
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,280
Damn it! We just have to fight!

18
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,620
I'd rather die fighting than be enslaved!

19
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,580
Listen up. We're taking them alive.

20
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,420
They're worth less when injured.

21
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,630
Be gentle with them.

22
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,180
Time we have a little fun.

23
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,980
What?

24
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,770
Bjorn?

25
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,280
Thors!

26
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,670
Listen!

27
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,050
Your fighting strength
has already been halved.

28
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,510
Retreat and keep your lives.

29
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,070
Leave, pirates!

30
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,820
You cannot win against me.

31
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,740
Bastard.

32
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,910
Stop. We can't shoot
until Askeladd gives the signal.

33
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,120
What's going on?

34
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,620
We've got the high ground.

35
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,160
What's he waiting for?

36
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,590
What an astounding man.

37
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,590
He's standing his ground
against two ships all by himself.

38
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,670
Leif, we should fight too!

39
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,550
Fool! You amateurs
will only get in the way.

40
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,180
There are arrows aimed at us from above.

41
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,560
He's the most experienced among us.

42
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,560
But.

43
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,110
Don't you get it?

44
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:29,860
Unlike Thors, we're just a bunch
of children and amateurs.

45
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,610
All we can do is rely on him.

46
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,290
These men aren't the type
to leave quietly when asked.

47
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,040
For now,
the archers on the cliff won't shoot.

48
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,300
There's roughly 30 men.
That's too many for me to handle alone.

49
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,670
The ships are too close.

50
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,970
If they jump over all at once,
the fight will be chaotic.

51
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,180
If only I were alone.

52
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,450
You're the leader.

53
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,450
In the name of almighty Odin,

54
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,830
I challenge you to a duel.

55
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,290
A duel?

56
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,040
If you win, you may do as you wish.

57
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,170
If I win, you will promptly
withdraw your men.

58
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,840
If you refuse,

59
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,260
you will gain a mere 12 slaves
while losing three times that of your men.

60
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,180
May I ask a question?

61
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,390
Why do you assume I'm the leader?

62
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,480
Your scent.

63
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,780
Very impressive.

64
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,870
All right. I accept your challenge.

65
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,290
I, Askeladd, son of Olaf,
swear it in the name of Odin!

66
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,120
Everyone, move to the bow of the ship.

67
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,540
All right.

68
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,770
I, too,

69
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,310
knew you by your scent.

70
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,070
You and I have the same smell.

71
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,240
Troll of Jom.

72
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,280
He knows me?

73
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,870
It was Floki.

74
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,660
You have good intuition.

75
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,750
I like smart people.

76
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,420
Don't you dare think
that you're the same as my father!

77
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,880
Enough. Get back!

78
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,500
My father is strong!

79
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,880
Die, pirate!

80
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,090
You're stupid and your armor's weird!

81
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,140
What a lively little brat. Your son?

82
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,430
Enough, you idiot. Stop it.

83
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,390
Askeladd, do you have a wife and children?

84
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,980
No.

85
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,520
I see.

86
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,110
Let's begin.

87
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,960
He's awfully casually
closing the gap between us.

88
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,070
Too shallow!

89
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,660
That's our leader!

90
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,670
There's no one who can match Askeladd!

91
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,670
Father!

92
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,880
He managed to dodge certain death.

93
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,300
I won't be able to surprise him again.

94
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,720
It was worth coming
all this way to this remote land.

95
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,640
He's no ordinary man.

96
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,770
Thors.

97
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,480
You're strong.

98
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,410
Give it up, Askeladd.

99
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,870
I won't go easy on you.

100
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,620
I'm glad I met you, Thors.

101
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,970
What?

102
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Amazing. He's overwhelming him!

103
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,950
Is Askeladd in trouble?

104
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,450
He's still defending against every blow.

105
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,000
Father!

106
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,960
Kill that scoundrel!

107
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,260
Oh, no.

108
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,800
He was aiming for my sword?

109
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,130
It can't take much more.

110
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,470
Which means
his sword is also at its limit.

111
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,980
Now!

112
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,980
I know where he's aiming,

113
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,940
so I can predict the swing of his sword!

114
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,450
Now he'll swing wide!

115
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,950
He got me.

116
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,370
He wanted me to swing big
to catch me off guard.

117
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,630
He wanted me to break his sword.

118
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,380
Everything went as he'd predicted.

119
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,510
Damn.

120
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,130
To think I'd played right into his hands.

121
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,340
Yes!

122
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,640
Thors!

123
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,220
-Amazing!
-That's my father!

124
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,520
He won!

125
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,060
What's wrong?

126
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,400
Kill me.

127
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,900
There is no need for that.

128
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,530
Concede defeat. That is enough.

129
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm the leader, you know.

130
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,540
I can't surrender in front of my men.

131
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,090
What's wrong? Kill me.

132
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,550
This duel will never end
unless you kill me.

133
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,770
My head hurts.

134
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,070
What?

135
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,950
What's happening?

136
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,330
Askeladd.

137
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,370
Lost.

138
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,460
He lost?

139
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,500
Admit it.

140
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,460
I have won this duel.

141
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,500
Withdraw your soldiers now!

142
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,470
You're truly strong, Thors.

143
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,890
You're worthy of leading your own army.

144
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,350
But why?

145
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,730
With skills like that,
why hide in Iceland for 15 years?

146
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,770
Don't you think it's a waste?

147
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,730
I do not.

148
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,400
Having to rely on something like this…

149
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,280
means I still have much to learn.

150
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,160
A true warrior needs no sword.

151
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,090
Thors, would you…

152
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,600
become our leader?

153
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm joking!

154
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,700
Come on, why is no one laughing?

155
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,700
It was a joke.

156
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,080
What was that? Just a joke?

157
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,960
This isn't the time

158
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,550
to be joking with a straight face!

159
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,010
None of you move!

160
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,770
I'll slice the kid's head right off!

161
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,100
Drop your sword!

162
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,690
Do it quickly!

163
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,940
Askeladd, you bastard!

164
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,490
Father!

165
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,660
My goodness, you are soft-hearted.

166
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,410
Did you really think
we'd respect the rules of the duel?

167
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,840
We just wanted to have a little fun.

168
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,920
We wanted to see
who the Troll of Jom was for ourselves.

169
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,680
It was fun.

170
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,070
Askeladd.

171
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,830
You've violated the rules of the duel.

172
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,500
Victory belongs to me.

173
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,080
It doesn't matter.

174
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,290
I'm only after your head.

175
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,550
I know.

176
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,940
All right.

177
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,070
This victory…

178
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,620
is yours.

179
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:20,800
Father!

180
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,400
Father…

181
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,860
Askeladd.

182
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,740
I've won this duel.

183
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,490
Do not go against your word as a warrior.

184
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,500
I know.

185
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,670
In the name of my ancestor Artorius,
I'll withdraw my soldiers immediately.

186
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,260
Leif.

187
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,670
Sorry, but I need a favor.

188
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,680
Take my head to Sigvaldi,
the leader of the Jomsvikings.

189
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,060
If they think I avoided
the call of war and hid once more,

190
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,820
they will take vengeance on the village.

191
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,690
How could this happen to you.

192
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,030
You there.

193
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,330
I've given my life as you wanted.

194
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,830
Release that child now!

195
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,130
Father!

196
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,650
Thank goodness.

197
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,400
You're safe for now.

198
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,050
Foolish brat.

199
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,590
Cherish your life from now on.

200
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,220
Be grateful to Thors.

201
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,680
His death is worth more than a hundred
of you worthless bastards.

202
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,950
Father is dead.

203
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,580
He was so strong.

204
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,370
Why did he throw his sword?

205
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,000
How could he say warriors need no swords?

206
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,260
That's not true at all!

207
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,760
Why?

208
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,430
Why did Father have to die?

209
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,760
Damn it.

210
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,480
That bastard lost to Father!

211
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,940
Damn it!

212
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,520
How could he live when father's dead?

213
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,280
Damn it.

214
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,030
Damn it!

215
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,790
They abandoned such a nice ship.

216
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,960
What a drastic decision.

217
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,300
Without Thors, they couldn't move it.

218
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,090
He alone could row for five men.

219
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,430
Wow…

220
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,520
But it worked out well for us
since we wanted a third ship.

221
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,140
Huh?

222
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,530
Twenty-eight are injured,
but how many are dead?

223
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,650
None?

224
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,530
Not one? That's impossible!

225
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,490
Askeladd!

226
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,290
Hey!

227
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,200
Come to the stern!

228
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,870
Askeladd!

229
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,710
What is it? Shut up already.

230
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,180
It's Thors's kid.

231
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,760
He must've been hiding below deck.

232
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,390
Look. He's even got a grown-up's dagger.

233
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,570
He's coming to kill us all!

234
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,530
Oh, no! I'm so scared!

235
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,740
How dare you.

236
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,290
How dare you kill my father!

237
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,750
I'll kill you!

238
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,000
I swear I'll kill you!

239
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,500
I'm going to kill you!

240
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,800
I'll kill you!

241
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,930
He's just a kid,

242
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,310
but look at those eyes.

243
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,730
What should we do with him, Askeladd?

244
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,020
Throw him overboard?

245
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,530
Let him be.

246
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,860
He'll be dead soon anyway.

247
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,790
Father.

248
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
