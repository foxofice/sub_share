1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Hey, you all right?

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,020
Who's that?

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,400
He's gigantic.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,110
What about our duel?

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,360
What did he say? A duel?

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,200
The duel!

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,330
Get your ass up!

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,790
Hey, he got up!

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,580
He didn't die!

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,290
You can still fight.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,630
Take time to recover.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,210
Don't mock me! Come at me now!

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,380
No, you certainly can't fight like that.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,720
Shut up! I don't need your pity--

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,640
What did I tell you?

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
Hey, old man!

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,440
Stop!

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,600
Let him go.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,650
Bring me a chair.

20
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,190
Let me look at it.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,610
Back off, geezer.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,820
See to your own injuries.

23
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,070
Just let me see.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,280
Don't touch me!

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,790
Don't get so worked up.

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,250
That's a bad habit.

27
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:09,460
Use your mind.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,540
Think. What must you do to win this duel?

29
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,470
It's been a while
since I've had so much fun, Thorfinn.

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,640
As promised, I'll tell you a story.

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,430
I'll tell you about your father, Thors.

32
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,690
So you know about the Jomsvikings.

33
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,740
Thors and I
were both battalion commanders.

34
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,080
Even among us,
Thors was clearly the strongest.

35
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,120
The Jomsvikings
only take the best warriors.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,750
But even then,
he earned his nickname the Troll.

37
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,210
Our supreme commander Sigvaldi
took a liking to him,

38
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
and gave his daughter's hand to Thors.

39
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,510
That was your mother, Helga.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,430
The leader of the Jomsvikings

41
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,930
is my grandfather?

42
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,310
That's right.

43
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,230
And my older brother.

44
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,110
In other words, I am your great-uncle.

45
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,240
He's related to the commander?

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Unbelievable!

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,530
Our last battle together
was at Hjörungavágr in Norway.

48
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,450
Our side was losing.

49
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,250
During the battle,

50
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,210
Thors fell into the water
and never resurfaced.

51
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,330
I wept.

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,260
I had planned to defeat him someday
with my own two hands.

53
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,930
But Thors was never really dead.

54
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,100
The last time I saw him was in Jomsborg,

55
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,480
about three months after his funeral.

56
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,060
-Then he got scared and pissed himself.
-Are you serious?

57
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,230
Come out. The watchmen are gone.

58
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,990
Hey!

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,990
Are you petty thieves?

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,120
Do you know that this is the home
of battalion leader Thors?

61
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,210
Thorkell.

62
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,130
Normally, I'd let petty thieves go.

63
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
But ever since I just lost my good friend,

64
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,220
I've been in a bad mood.

65
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,610
Thors?

66
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,400
You…

67
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,610
Well, what do you know!

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,280
Where have you been?

69
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,070
We held a funeral for you!

70
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
All right, already. Calm down, Thorkell.

71
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,410
I'm sorry for worrying you.

72
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,750
Oh, now I can see, that's Helga?

73
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,210
Why are the two of you
wearing the matching clothes of beggers?

74
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,420
Uncle Thorkell…

75
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,920
I knew it.

76
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,260
You couldn't die falling into the sea.

77
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,300
I'm sorry, Uncle, but we--

78
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,720
Have you seen my brother? Not yet?
All right, I'll rouse him for you.

79
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,600
Thorkell.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,480
-Please listen to me.
-Okay!

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,230
We have much to discuss.
Let's talk inside.

82
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,360
What's wrong?

83
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,160
I will not go see the leader.

84
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,620
We are leaving this place.

85
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,240
Why?

86
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,040
Do it tomorrow.

87
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,620
You've just come home.

88
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,870
I am leaving town

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
and the Jomsvikings.

90
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,300
Could you forget
that you ever saw us tonight?

91
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,970
What? Is this a joke?

92
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,390
Continue telling the story of my death.

93
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,100
Please, Thorkell.

94
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,100
I don't follow you.

95
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,310
Why suddenly now?

96
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,150
I've made a decision.

97
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,870
I won't fight anymore.

98
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,870
Like I said, I don't follow you!

99
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,290
It's hard to believe
that you're afraid of death.

100
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,380
My brother thinks of you as his successor.

101
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,380
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,550
You're tired, right?

103
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,180
Just eat something
and sleep for the night.

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,100
I've come to understand…

105
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,600
what it means to be a true warrior.

106
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,980
That is why

107
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,230
we cannot stay here.

108
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,830
You know the code.

109
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,960
Those who leave without a pardon
are sentenced to death.

110
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,340
This is the warrior capital.

111
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,720
You're made only for fighting.
Where would you go?

112
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,800
Somewhere that's not here.

113
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,230
Thors.

114
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,440
It will be fine.

115
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,640
Stay back.

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,820
Take care, Thorkell.

117
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,900
Where is your sword?

118
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,530
I don't need it.

119
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,210
When I came to,
Thors and his family were gone.

120
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,800
Fifteen years later,
I learned that Thors had died for real.

121
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,970
I've thought about him for 15 years

122
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,140
and realized the life and death
of the body is not what matters.

123
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,070
What's important to a warrior
is the soul and where it goes.

124
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,860
Thors's soul has gone far away.

125
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,780
To a place that I don't know.

126
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,410
To a place that I still can't reach.

127
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,790
To somewhere that's not here.

128
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm sure he has become
a true warrior there.

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,710
Thorfinn,

130
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,710
what kind of life did he live in Iceland?

131
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,550
Tell me.

132
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,180
I don't want to.

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,930
What?

134
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,970
But I told you!

135
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,180
Shut up! I don't care!

136
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,600
How selfish.

137
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,730
Besides, you probably won't tell
because you can't.

138
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,110
I can tell by your eyes.

139
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,570
You lack the light that was in his eyes.

140
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,490
What'd you say?

141
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,570
You're afraid we're going to find out
you didn't learn anything from Thors.

142
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,450
Wait.

143
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,660
Let me go or I'll kill you first!

144
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,040
You will lose if you go after him now.

145
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,170
What'd I say?

146
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,880
Your victory or defeat
is my life or death.

147
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,180
I will teach you…

148
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,180
how to defeat that monster.

149
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,850
Don't spout nonsense, geezer!

150
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,020
If you knew that,
then why didn't you fight him?

151
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,560
War and chess are different, boy.

152
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,070
The war doesn't end
when the leader is taken.

153
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,030
But this time is different.

154
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,240
If you win, he said he'll let us go.

155
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,740
He takes his honor seriously.

156
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,120
He'll abide by the honor of the duel.

157
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,670
Remember the reason why you're fighting.

158
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,210
You want to kill me in a duel, don't you?

159
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,340
For the time being,

160
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,470
consider me your adviser.

161
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,970
This is for the both of us to survive.

162
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,610
I wanted to see the commander's duel.

163
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,950
I want to go out
in a duel with the commander, too.

164
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,530
I'd enter Valhalla with pride.

165
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,700
He's on a different level, an incarnation
of the god of thunder, Thor.

166
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,790
If the commander is Thor, then does
that mean Prince Canute is Freyja?

167
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,040
A goddess!

168
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,050
What? It's Freyja's incarnation.

169
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,010
Take this!

170
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,230
Does it hurt, Thorfinn?

171
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,560
Why not abandon Askeladd

172
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,730
and surrender?

173
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:31,700
Bastard!

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,580
Don't run away!

175
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,250
Don't you know when to give up?

176
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,370
What's with you?

177
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,840
Fight with honor to the end!

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,800
Are you trying to sully Thors's name?

179
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,920
Damn you.

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Endure it for now, Thorfinn.

181
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,100
Have him come to you.

182
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,560
It was at the Battle of Maldon.

183
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,980
It was a vicious battle.

184
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,900
Everyone was severely wounded,
even Thorkell.

185
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,280
Just one moment.

186
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,780
At that moment I saw it.

187
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,410
The moment
the invincible Thorkell crumbled.

188
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,590
Very good.

189
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,970
Make him think
you've exhausted your options.

190
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,300
What's wrong, Thorfinn?

191
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,970
Tired of running?

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,850
How disappointing.

193
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,440
I figured you'd have more fighting spirit.

194
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,900
Good positioning.

195
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,860
Well done, Thorfinn.

196
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,820
He is so lame.

197
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,030
Pathetic.

198
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,320
He just evaded.

199
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,330
Yes, Thorkell.

200
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,450
Come to put an end to him.

201
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,420
Final moment.

202
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,500
Last chance.

203
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,510
His weakness is…

204
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,990
Commander!

205
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,120
You fool! You don't have a weapon!

206
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,500
Thorfinn! To your right!

207
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
Kill the brat!

208
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,010
Damn it!

209
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,220
Die, brat!

210
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,810
Stop, you fools!

211
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,650
How dare you bastards disgrace me
with your impudence?

212
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,560
But Commander!

213
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,570
How dare you defile my duel
with your interference!

214
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,240
Asgeir, you bastard.

215
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,620
Where is your honor as a warrior?

216
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,160
You can begrudge me.

217
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,580
But I will kill that boy.

218
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,880
If you're going to kill me, do it.

219
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,880
But you must live!

220
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,640
Who else is going to unify
these 500 brutes?

221
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
That is enough.

222
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,230
Stop this fight.

223
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,450
Those who die in this battle
will die in vain.

224
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,540
It can't be.

225
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,500
Everyone has been killed.

226
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,460
Askeladd's army…

227
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
Brother!

228
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,760
You're alive?

229
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Good man, who are you?

230
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,230
Brother.

231
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,980
Relentless.

232
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,400
How could you kill each other like this?

233
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,530
Royalty has no right
to interfere in a duel.

234
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,450
Stay out of it, princess.

235
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,160
In this state, this is no longer a duel.

236
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,000
If you are the leader of a faction.

237
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,750
You must show honor and sportsmanship.

238
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,630
Shut up!

239
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,260
I am well aware without your interference!

240
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,230
Let Thorfinn go.

241
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,980
I've lost the duel.

242
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,610
You haven't lost! We interfered!

243
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,530
Shut up, you imbeciles!

244
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,570
I lost.

245
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,660
Let me retain my dignity.

246
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,540
Asgeir.

247
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,370
Do as your commander has ordered.

248
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,050
What a calamity.

249
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,090
I've never had a more miserable day
in my 50 years on earth!

250
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,390
Drink!

251
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,430
Hey, geezer! Now's our chance to get away.

252
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,810
Go if you want.

253
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,480
-I'm staying.
-What?

254
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,650
Then what was I fighting for?

255
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,110
Shut up and watch.

256
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,530
So? What do you want, Prince?

257
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,950
Have you casually come
to arbitrate our fight?

258
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,160
I require a sled and some provisions.

259
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,000
And Thorfinn and Askeladd
are in my service.

260
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,250
They're mine.

261
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,500
You're out of your mind.

262
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,840
What hunter would let
his prey to walk away?

263
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,550
By taking me you can secure
an audience with King Sweyn.

264
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,260
Is that what you're thinking?

265
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,430
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,480
You're valuable bait as a hostage.

267
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,440
Give up on the prince!

268
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,650
Don't get greedy!

269
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,150
Just watch!

270
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,400
Back away, lackey. I will not run.

271
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,660
You have learned to talk like a man
in such a short time.

272
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,790
What happened?

273
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,000
I saw Ragnar's corpse
in the village we passed.

274
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,800
Thorkell.

275
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,970
I have no value as a hostage.

276
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,930
That is because…

277
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,010
my father

278
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,140
has no love for me.

279
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,520
My father will pass the crown
to my elder brother Harald.

280
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,650
I am insurance for brother
and nothing more.

281
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,240
Because of this, the king's retainers
are squabbling for power,

282
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,830
and jeopardizing
the foundation of the kingdom.

283
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,120
My existence is at the root
of my father's troubles.

284
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,340
So King Sweyn
is hoping that I will kill you?

285
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,970
It's more convenient for me to die
in battle than by assassination.

286
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,140
My father can wash his hands clean
of his child's death.

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,270
Supposing that I let you go free,
where would you go?

288
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,100
To the base
of the home army in Gainsborough.

289
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,900
To fight my father, the king.

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,990
You think you can win?

291
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,870
Good luck with that.

292
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,990
I'm only doing what I must.

293
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:10,700
Either way,

294
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,950
my life has no value.

295
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,420
I have heard

296
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,180
more men than I can count say
that their lives have no value.

297
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,310
Yet most cry and beg for their lives
at the slighest provecation.

298
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,350
Are you like them too?

299
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,480
Huh?

300
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,660
I hate that look.

301
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,620
I've seen eyes like these before.

302
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,550
What are you looking at
through those eyes?

303
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,180
What?

304
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,640
They're completely silent.

305
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,680
Bastards.

306
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,900
I, too, have a regret, though only one.

307
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,860
Why didn't I go with Thors back then?

308
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,360
Had I gone with him,

309
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,330
I would have learned
what it means to be a true warrior.

310
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,210
Well, fighting King Sweyn changes nothing.

311
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,550
All right! I've decided!

312
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,220
I will aid you in your fight.

313
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,510
I will accompany you.

314
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,640
I will see for myself what you will do
and who you will become.

315
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,400
But if you do something weak,
I'll kill you myself.

316
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,570
Agreed.

317
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,570
Then from today, you shall be my retainer.

318
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,780
What? Then what are we supposed to do?

319
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,370
I guess we just follow the commander.

320
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,840
What's with him?

321
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,210
He's still here?

322
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,100
Prince Canute.

323
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,610
I was the one who killed Ragnar.

324
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,110
Please, cut me down.

325
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
However,

326
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,530
if you spare my life,

327
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,240
I'll be your servant

328
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,330
even if it costs me my life.

329
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,670
You will work Ragnar's position.

330
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,880
That will serve as consolation.

331
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,800
Yes. I swear it.

332
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Those who wish to follow me, come.

333
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,650
I will drag King Sweyn down
from his throne.

334
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,110
What's with you? Don't imitate me.

335
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,690
I'm not imitating.

336
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,410
I became his servant before you.

337
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,990
In either case we should be friends.

338
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,910
I killed all your men,
but that's water under the bridge, right?

339
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,050
No matter what we do, everything
will have to be water under the bridge.

340
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,930
