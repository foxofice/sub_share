1
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:05,466
Where is the key…

2
00:00:06,508 --> 00:00:07,760
Found it.

3
00:00:20,648 --> 00:00:21,565
Ouch!

4
00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:28,239
The heck.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,035
Phew.

6
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:46,548
Off.

7
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:50,177
Off.

8
00:02:00,372 --> 00:02:01,415
Nice.

9
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:08,422
Right, what do I need
to see Ms. Makima for?

10
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:11,967
Never mind.

11
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,932
Water…

12
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,722
What's this? Denji.

13
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:02,184
Why are you at my place?

14
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:06,772
Did I bring you here?

15
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,320
I feel dizzy. What the hell?

16
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:20,160
Oh right. You like Ms. Makima, don't you?

17
00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:22,955
My head's spinning.

18
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:26,834
You shouldn't like her.

19
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,294
Jeez, Aki too.

20
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,380
Why does he have to act so shy?

21
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,259
Boo… Moo…

22
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:36,468
Cow.

23
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,377
Let's do it.

24
00:05:38,674 --> 00:05:42,010
CHAINSAW MAN

25
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:49,268
Do…

26
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,187
Do what?

27
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,066
Sex.

28
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:01,738
Arms up.

29
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:12,582
That's right.

30
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,459
Good boy.

31
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,086
<i>Should I do this?</i>

32
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:17,546
Good boy.

33
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,674
<i>My first kiss was supposed
to be with Ms. Makima.</i>

34
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:21,591
That's right.

35
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,677
<i>But I gave it to a woman
with a mouth of vomit.</i>

36
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:26,972
<i>Do I really want my first time
to be taken by the same one?</i>

37
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:32,602
Yes!

38
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:41,820
Good boy.

39
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:46,825
Let's take these pants off too.

40
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:02,674
There's something in your pocket.

41
00:07:06,053 --> 00:07:08,889
A Chupa Chups? It's dirty!

42
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,893
<i>Denji…</i>

43
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:16,271
Denji, are you okay?

44
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:18,690
Want some fresh air?

45
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:32,412
I bought nausea medicine
from the supermarket.

46
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:35,165
Take it with water before bed.

47
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,295
Ms. Makima, I…

48
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,049
I had a crappy first kiss.

49
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,637
Even if I kiss different women
from now on,

50
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,432
I'll think of the taste of vomit

51
00:07:53,183 --> 00:07:55,769
every time I do it.

52
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,273
Open your mouth.

53
00:08:12,035 --> 00:08:14,788
You probably won't ever forget
the taste of vomit.

54
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,166
But don't worry.

55
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,294
From now until your death,

56
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:24,131
you'll experience
all kinds of first tastes.

57
00:08:24,715 --> 00:08:27,551
You won't have time to
remember the taste of vomit.

58
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:32,389
So your first indirect kiss

59
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:35,392
<i>is the taste of
a cola-flavored Chupa Chups.</i>

60
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:44,693
Sorry, Pochita.

61
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:47,237
I bet you wanted to do it too.

62
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,322
But I…

63
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,658
I want to save it for Ms. Makima.

64
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:55,245
Until I kill Gun Devil.

65
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,498
Until then, I…

66
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,884
Morning, Denji.

67
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,806
Feeling up to breakfast?

68
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,898
Eating while looking down
at people is the best.

69
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,108
Denji.

70
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:29,613
I got so drunk last night,
I don't remember a thing.

71
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,991
Did I do anything to you?

72
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:35,410
Like I'd do it with a vomit lady.

73
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:37,996
I decided my first time's
gonna be with Ms. Makima.

74
00:09:40,624 --> 00:09:42,709
Thank god.

75
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:46,338
I'd get arrested if I made
a move on a minor.

76
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:59,351
You are a strange one.

77
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:03,063
Most people would get
uncomfortable and leave now.

78
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:07,108
Huh? Why would I leave
when I can get free food?

79
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,363
So, Denji, you like Ms. Makima too?

80
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:12,739
Yes, I do.

81
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:16,618
Even if she's got a crappy personality?

82
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:17,619
Yes.

83
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:23,250
Okay then.

84
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,336
I'll set you up with her.

85
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:28,421
Really?

86
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:29,756
Yes.

87
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,593
Denji, how about we form
a secret alliance?

88
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,972
I'll help you get with Ms. Makima.

89
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:38,932
And you help me with Aki.

90
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,317
What do you like about that guy?

91
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,318
His face.

92
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,657
All right, I'm in.

93
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,701
Let's do this alliance.

94
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:02,789
So, we are no longer
senior and junior from now.

95
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:04,124
Let's be friends.

96
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,590
Come over for breakfast once in a while.

97
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:13,675
And bring that Fiend and Aki.

98
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:22,392
Do you think Ms. Makima would come too?

99
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,365
When will we arrive in Kyoto again?

100
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,743
In 30 minutes.

101
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,037
I'll buy a boxed meal then.

102
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,539
You have a luncheon at one, miss.

103
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,250
I'll make room by then.

104
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,339
I don't really want to meet
with the Kyoto bigwigs.

105
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,466
They are all so scary.

106
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:58,094
I'd rather have my lunch
in a relaxed mood.

107
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:02,974
The drinks yesterday were delicious.

108
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:40,887
This is Team C…

109
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,930
Commence operation.

110
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,578
What's that noise?

111
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:48,788
You don't know? How dumb!

112
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:50,498
It's the sound of <i>taiko</i> drums.

113
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:51,624
Is there a festival?

114
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,792
Oh right.

115
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:55,628
You two really didn't mate last night?

116
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,716
Denji is actually a gentleman.

117
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,471
I can't believe
you can eat the ramen here.

118
00:14:05,138 --> 00:14:06,765
Doesn't it taste terrible?

119
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,519
Who are you?

120
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:13,772
Tastes fine to me!

121
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:16,065
Don't speak to me as if you know me!

122
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,069
I see you can't judge the quality of food.

123
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:22,030
You can't help it though.

124
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:25,241
It's said that if you only eat
the same thing in your childhood,

125
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:27,660
your palate will be unrefined as an adult.

126
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,623
And an unrefined palate
lowers your happiness.

127
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,166
I'm very happy!

128
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,918
Let's go.

129
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:37,587
My grandpa was
the kindest man in the world.

130
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,590
He brought me to
fancy restaurants all the time.

131
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:46,471
He was yakuza, but he had principles.

132
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,057
You might call people like him

133
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:51,810
a necessary evil.

134
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,772
He's only killed a few women and children.

135
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,818
He'd buy me anything I wanted
with the drug money.

136
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:03,446
He was a good man

137
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,490
whom everybody loved.

138
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,662
You loved him too, right? Denji?

139
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,874
What are you getting at?

140
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:16,042
Do you know him?

141
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:20,380
Gun Devil wants your heart.

142
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,225
-Samurai Head!
-Kon!

143
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:52,036
Aki Hayakawa…

144
00:15:52,912 --> 00:15:56,624
You put something monstrous in my mouth.

145
00:15:57,917 --> 00:15:59,043
It's neither human

146
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:00,837
not devil…

147
00:16:15,101 --> 00:16:17,770
Power. Stop Himeno's bleeding.

148
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:19,397
A nail?

149
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:29,532
Fire!

150
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,036
Three.

151
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,175
Fire!

152
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:49,761
Two.

153
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:56,517
Fire!

154
00:16:58,895 --> 00:16:59,729
One.

155
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:06,027
I've had enough of that creepy thing.

156
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,779
Curse! Kill him!

157
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,822
Zero.

158
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:39,310
How's Himeno?

159
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,273
We'd better take her to a doctor now.

160
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,149
That guy…

161
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,235
He had a gun.

162
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,697
But only police officers and Devil Hunters

163
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,282
can obtain guns in Japan.

164
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:57,370
Gun Devil wants your heart.

165
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,666
We should get Himeno
medical treatment first.

166
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:03,167
Your Curse Devil.

167
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,005
Run that nail through someone
enough times and they'll die.

168
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,423
Am I right?

169
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,384
Nice moves on your part.

170
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,594
Where did you come from?

171
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,346
Are you with him?

172
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,242
How did you lose?

173
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:39,370
I had my guard down.
I really had my guard down.

174
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:40,830
Well, kill him then.

175
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,157
He's still alive.

176
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:19,577
The Devil Hunters' suits are sturdy.

177
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:21,079
Finish him off.

178
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,793
Leave me. Go save Aki.

179
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:28,086
No way.

180
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,797
I can't even see his moves.

181
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:32,632
Ghost…

182
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,134
I refuse.

183
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:37,929
That girl is scary.

184
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:58,491
I will give you all of me.

185
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,828
So let me use all of you.

186
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,559
<i>Aki can cry.</i>

187
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:33,234
<i>Devil Hunters get so used to death</i>

188
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:34,569
<i>that they eventually stop crying.</i>

189
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:38,114
<i>But Aki cries very often.</i>

190
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,410
<i>When his newbies died,</i>

191
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:44,704
<i>he'd hide away and cry,
and it's very interesting.</i>

192
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:49,375
<i>It must be a really good feeling</i>

193
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,463
<i>to have someone care and cry for you.</i>

194
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,347
Hey! Help me!

195
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:25,620
Aki…

196
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,455
Don't die.

197
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:32,710
When I die…

198
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:39,175
I hope you can cry for me.

199
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:41,844
Snake, swallow it.

200
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:54,732
Return.
