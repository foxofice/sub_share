1
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:15,768
This one's for you.

2
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:22,024
Cigarettes are bad for the bones.
I don't want it.

3
00:00:22,107 --> 00:00:24,485
I have a feeling that
we'll be teammates for a long time.

4
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:26,237
I really hope you can smoke.

5
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:33,494
Just this one then.

6
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:37,498
I'll smoke just this once in my life.

7
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:38,707
Yeah.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,959
I'll light it for you.

9
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:44,380
Making a minor smoke…
You're a terrible senior.

10
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:45,714
You're a minor?

11
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:47,424
Yeah.

12
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:50,552
Then of course, you can't smoke.

13
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:57,309
Give me that.

14
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,482
I'll keep this cigarette for you.

15
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,987
I'll give it back

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,073
when you're all grown up and
need something to take the edge off.

17
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:27,983
<i>The Ghost Devil has no eyes.</i>

18
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,568
<i>What it sees is fear.</i>

19
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,738
<i>That's what Himeno told me.</i>

20
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:52,049
<i>Himeno.</i>

21
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,677
<i>I'll join you soon.</i>

22
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,089
CHAINSAW MAN

23
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,938
Snake.

24
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,022
Don't kill her.

25
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,542
Kobeni.

26
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,710
Why did you stay at Public Safety?

27
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,051
Because we'll get our bonuses soon…

28
00:05:58,694 --> 00:06:00,612
Gross.

29
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:03,991
Meat is meat.

30
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,368
Pork, beef, human. It's all the same.

31
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,203
It's totally different!

32
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,208
Our job is to capture Katana Man.

33
00:06:13,292 --> 00:06:15,585
You'd better not eat him when we do!

34
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,422
Bastard…

35
00:06:28,515 --> 00:06:30,434
They haven't noticed us.

36
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:32,019
Don't make any loud noises.

37
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,690
My name is Power!

38
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:39,026
We can't beat these guys.

39
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:39,985
This is a battle!

40
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,531
Denji! Follow me!

41
00:06:45,157 --> 00:06:46,742
Watch my back!

42
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:53,749
How do you like that?

43
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,250
I'm not running away!

44
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,376
I'm dignified!

45
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,544
And beautiful!

46
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,715
A strong enemy is coming!

47
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,884
Watch this, Denji…

48
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,385
and tell the tale!

49
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:08,513
Power is the strongest of all!

50
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,709
There you are, sideburns man.

51
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,463
Wait… Why don't we have a talk first?

52
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:49,763
We're willing to surrender
depending on your attitude.

53
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,725
All we want is closure for our anger.

54
00:07:58,313 --> 00:07:59,523
Denji.

55
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:02,984
You killed their friends and my grandpa.

56
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,445
We want you to pay for that.

57
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:10,492
I killed your buddies and your grandpa
because they turned into zombies.

58
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:11,910
Don't lie to me!

59
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,621
Uneducated idiots are always quick to lie!

60
00:08:16,832 --> 00:08:18,208
Never mind.

61
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,294
Even if that were true,

62
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:23,171
zombies were once human.

63
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:26,800
Don't you feel guilty for killing them?

64
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:28,301
Not a bit.

65
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,098
Sawatari had made some changes on me.

66
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,561
My heart seems to have been replaced
with the Katana Devil's.

67
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,771
But even I…

68
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:43,942
can't sleep well
when I kill zombies by accident.

69
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:49,197
I think you've lost your human heart.

70
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,451
If you have any semblance
of a human conscience left,

71
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:55,537
you should let us kill you.

72
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,086
Nope!

73
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:06,256
I see.

74
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:09,050
Then I'll cut you down!

75
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,553
Come and get me, moron!

76
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,937
What?

77
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:24,524
I thought you were going to cut me down?

78
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:32,908
Die!

79
00:09:37,954 --> 00:09:39,206
Damn!

80
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,180
Take this!

81
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,831
Your moves are faster now.

82
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:24,751
Denji, what are you fighting for?

83
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:29,339
To protect the life I have now, I guess.

84
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:33,051
So you people in Public Safety
are enjoying your life a lot.

85
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:39,099
One of them is annoying,
the other one is a brat.

86
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:40,934
But overall I'm happy with it.

87
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:46,606
So I'll finish you real quick
to have Ms. Makima commend me.

88
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:50,235
You can't beat me.

89
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:53,697
Do you think you've already won?

90
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,448
I'm not dead yet.

91
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:56,449
Dirty scum!

92
00:11:20,765 --> 00:11:21,891
Where did he go?

93
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,566
-<i>Due to a disturbance inside the train,</i>
-Get off!

94
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:31,276
<i>we will now be making an emergency stop.</i>

95
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:34,779
<i>All passengers, please evacuate
immediately after the doors are open.</i>

96
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:36,031
<i>I repeat.</i>

97
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,950
<i>Due to a disturbance inside the train,</i>

98
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:40,660
<i>we will now be making an emergency stop.</i>

99
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:43,872
<i>All passengers, please evacuate
immediately after the doors are open.</i>

100
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:46,708
Hey…

101
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:05,518
Come on, can you try something new?

102
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:07,020
You wish.

103
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:17,864
It is over.

104
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:20,784
You can't fight anymore.

105
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:22,994
Isn't that right, Denji?

106
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,373
Before you die,

107
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:29,209
apologize for killing my grandpa.

108
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:38,051
I can still fight.

109
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,766
Can't you see the chainsaw on my head?

110
00:12:44,849 --> 00:12:46,267
Idiot!

111
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,656
Didn't my grandpa teach you

112
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:01,908
to know when to quit?

113
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,870
Apologize to my grandpa

114
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:08,998
and I'll end your misery.

115
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,674
You carefully aimed for my head.

116
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:21,261
Thanks, moron.

117
00:13:28,518 --> 00:13:30,854
Didn't your grandpa teach you…

118
00:13:32,272 --> 00:13:34,858
that a beast should never trust

119
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:37,861
a hunter?

120
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:12,312
You woke up?

121
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:18,526
So you're the same as me.

122
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,738
When I pulled out your katana,

123
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:24,115
your body went back in one piece.

124
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:29,537
I'll kill… I'll kill you!

125
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:32,290
Losers are always the loudest.

126
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:38,213
I have to stick around
until the police show up for you.

127
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,800
But there's something I'm upset about.

128
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,970
You killed Ms. Himeno.

129
00:14:46,638 --> 00:14:48,098
It's all your fault.

130
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,059
Now there's one less
pretty girl in the world.

131
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:56,064
But you'll live out your life in prison
without being sorry?

132
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:58,900
I don't think that's fair.

133
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:02,654
As if you can do anything about it.

134
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:04,823
You're just a Public Safety dog!

135
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,331
I'm going to hold a tournament!

136
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,001
Tournament?

137
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,838
Perfect timing.

138
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,134
This is Hayakawa from Division 4.

139
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:28,012
Target is under control on the rail tracks
in front of the clock tower.

140
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,097
Please send backup.

141
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:32,142
Do you want to participate, Hayawaka?

142
00:15:32,225 --> 00:15:33,893
It's the ultimate tournament.

143
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,229
What exactly are you talking about?

144
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:41,651
This guy shot Ms. Himeno.

145
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:44,571
So we should give him nut shots too.

146
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,117
That's the tournament.

147
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,370
We'll take turns kicking him in the balls,

148
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:57,125
and whoever gets the loudest scream out of
him before the cops show up is the winner.

149
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:58,626
Are you serious?

150
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:08,511
Are you playing or not?

151
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:13,600
Our job is to capture him,

152
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,020
not to torture him to feel good.

153
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:22,066
Doing that won't make Himeno happy.

154
00:16:24,444 --> 00:16:26,029
Fine.

155
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:51,930
Answer me.

156
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:55,308
What do I get if I win?

157
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,145
His balls, of course.

158
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,401
Wait…

159
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:07,070
Wait!

160
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,858
<i>Himeno, can you hear this in heaven?</i>

161
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:54,993
<i>It's a requiem from us.</i>

162
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,251
This terrorist attack was instigated

163
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:07,714
by a former civilian Devil Hunter
named Akane Sawatari.

164
00:18:08,715 --> 00:18:11,009
She made a contract with the Gun Devil

165
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:13,011
and distributed guns to the yakuza.

166
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,763
In return,

167
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:19,267
they said Sawatari wanted
the Chainsaw Devil's heart.

168
00:18:19,851 --> 00:18:20,685
And?

169
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:25,273
Why did Sawatari want its heart?

170
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,817
Before we could obtain that information…

171
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:35,658
Suicide?

172
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,910
It may have been an involuntary suicide

173
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:40,663
because of her contract
with the Gun Devil.

174
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:46,502
We seized 1.4 kilos of Gun Devil flesh
from inside the building.

175
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,757
After we combined it with
the 5 kilos in our possession,

176
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,218
it finally started to move
toward the Gun Devil itself.

177
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:57,180
At last.

178
00:18:57,764 --> 00:18:59,432
Toward where?

179
00:22:52,415 --> 00:22:54,000
It's the same dream again.

180
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:58,212
The dream I always have…

181
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,465
and always forget.

182
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:04,593
Denji.

183
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,346
Pochita!

184
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,390
Come on out, Pochita!

185
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,851
At least let me touch you in my dream!

186
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:14,437
Denji…

187
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,273
Don't open it no matter what.

188
00:23:44,008 --> 00:23:45,593
Denji…

189
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,347
Between a country mouse and a city mouse,

190
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,141
which do you think is better?
