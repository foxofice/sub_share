1
00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.241
Must you go?

2
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.376
I¡¯ve promised.

3
00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:01.051
I said I¡¯d go to him.

4
00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.327
But you¡¯ll never make it back!

5
00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:09.594
Thank you.

6
00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:17.340
Don¡¯t go Please

7
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.444
¡®I¡¯ve always..¡¯

8
00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.812
An earthquakel

9
00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:56.444
You OK, Boss?

10
00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.242
Yeah.

11
00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:00.045
We¡¯re ready. The van¡¯s loaded.

12
00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:01.653
Be right there.

Ginei Studios

28
00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.511
It is with regret that
Ginei Studios, Ltd...

29
00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:12.412
announces its studio facility
is obsolete and will be closed.

30
00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:19.117
This project celebrates
its greatest star, Fujiwara Chiyoko...

31
00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:24.320
who sustained it through
much of its 70¡ªyear history...

32
00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.798
This is voice¡ªover!
I can¡¯t be in the shot!

33
00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:33.269
If you¡¯d gotten permission
to interview her sooner...

34
00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:37.070
...we wouldn¡¯t have to fake it

35
00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:39.973
She¡¯s not a performer any more

36
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.810
Then you should have shot this
30 years ago

37
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:57.258
The crazy old biddy...hiding
herself away like some hermit

38
00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:00.827
Next time I kill you

39
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.475
But no matter how big a star
she was, she¡¯s over 70 now.

40
00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.711
I mean...she¡¯s oId

41
00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:14.737
Look

42
00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:17.579
There it is!

43
00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:21.482
Let¡¯s not expect too much, eh?
We don¡¯t even know...

44
00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.181
what she looks like now.

45
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.583
She¡¯ll never grow old

46
00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:34.922
Um...

47
00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:37.500
Missus

48
00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:53.148
Does Miss Fujiwara
live here alone?

49
00:05:53.886 --> 00:06:00.052
She has for years...her friends
are her books and her garden.

50
00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:03.890
This is her own home¡ªmade
herb tea.

51
00:06:08.334 --> 00:06:11.735
But you¡¯re very lucky...

52
00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.172
she¡¯s agreed to let you
interview her.

53
00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:19.775
We went to a great deal
of trouble finding her.

54
00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.641
It¡¯s a great honor.

55
00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:25.877
But you said you had
something to give her?

56
00:06:25.985 --> 00:06:27.782
Uh, yes..

57
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:33.321
Before she¡¯ll meet anyone new,
usually the earth has to move.

58
00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.825
What has to move, Mino?

59
00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:39.190
The earth moves¡¯, Missus.

60
00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.597
Earthquake¡¯...that one
this morning.

61
00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.431
Wasn¡¯t that something!

62
00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:48.674
I thought my time had come!

63
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.645
How do you do.
I¡¯m Fujiwara Chiyoko.

64
00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:59.446
This is truly a great day.
We are most deeply honored.

65
00:06:59.719 --> 00:07:02.119
Oh, don¡¯t be so formal.

66
00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:04.916
You¡¯re from Studio...

67
00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.558
..Rootasu

68
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.321
It means lotus

69
00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.827
Oh, I love lotuses!

70
00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:17.459
I¡¯m aware of that.
Thus the name of our studio..

71
00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.837
They¡¯ll be in flower soon out back.

72
00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.439
In poetry they symbolize...

73
00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:27.843
Yes ¡®Simple purity¡¯.

74
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:34.712
Well, Mr Tachibana...
you mentioned ¡®something¡¯...

75
00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:38.015
Oh, yes I¡¯m sorry...

76
00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.555
I¡¯ve kept this...

77
00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:51.800
to give it to you
when I found where you were.

78
00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:00.606
All the while I meant to forget it...

79
00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:04.678
Was that the key
to something important?

80
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:08.650
To the most important thing
there is.

81
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:17.258
Thank you, Mr Tachibana.
But where did you get this?

82
00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:25.562
Uh...well, many years ago
someone at Ginei Studios found it.

83
00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:30.064
I never thought
I¡¯d hold it in my hand again.

84
00:08:44.924 --> 00:08:50.123
Well, I guess the earth
is telling us to get started.

85
00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.128
Uh, certainly.

86
00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.436
My fate seems to be
tied to earthquakes.

87
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.073
I was born during one,
in 1923.

88
00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.770
The Great Kanto Earthquake...

89
00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:14.350
My father had so wanted a childl
He was killed, and it was if...

90
00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:18.015
his life had been traded for mine.

91
00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:23.361
But the shop he left behind...

92
00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:28.125
allowed my mother and I
to live well.

93
00:09:32.605 --> 00:09:38.339
I grew up in a dangerous world
of one gamble after another...

94
00:09:38.844 --> 00:09:42.837
everything always
veering to the right.

95
00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:59.164
But girls¡¯ magazines were
more important to me, I guess.

96
00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:04.467
I¡¯d gaze at the pictures and dream
of the day I¡¯d meet my prince.

97
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.838
Was that when...

98
00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.539
the studio discovered you?

99
00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.342
I¡¯ll never know...

100
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.411
what the managing director
of Ginei Studios...

101
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.410
saw in a snub¡ªnosed little girl
on her way to school.

102
00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.886
Is there nothing I can say?

103
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.055
Nothing.

104
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.100
My mother here...

105
00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:40.763
thinks that being an actress
is a dubious profession.

106
00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:44.409
¡®Dubious¡¯, she called it?

107
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.802
Madame!

108
00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:51.341
Our new film is set in Manchuria.
It will cheer on our soldiers there...

109
00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.817
and encourage all the people
of our nation!

110
00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.148
Surely...

111
00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:59.655
...Chiyoko wants to be
of service to her country¡¯

112
00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:00.918
Um...

113
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.589
Perhaps, but this child is far
too timid to ever be an actress!

114
00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:10.725
She will find a husband
and succeed me in our store.

115
00:11:11.437 --> 00:11:12.404
Isn¡¯t that right?

116
00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:15.972
Does a sweetshop matter more
than a nation?

117
00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:23.276
Does a woman not serve her nation
by staying home and bearing children?

118
00:11:42.101 --> 00:11:46.663
National Health Week
Your Nation Needs You!

119
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:14.998
Um...

120
00:12:16.869 --> 00:12:18.496
What are we filming?

121
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.638
Chiyoko

122
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:27.711
I feel like a stalker

123
00:12:34.353 --> 00:12:35.411
Sorry

124
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.623
I was hurrying.

125
00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:50.131
Something¡¯s going on...

126
00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.464
Keep out of it

127
00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.342
He¡¯s not here

128
00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:58.670
Go that way

129
00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:19.658
Did a man come this way?
Carrying something in a cloth?

130
00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.081
He ran that way.

131
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.580
Go

132
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.353
Hey...

133
00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:38.000
It takes guts to shelter
someone like that!

134
00:14:38.244 --> 00:14:40.235
Who is that guy?!

135
00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.344
May I see?

136
00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:47.416
It¡¯s just a sketch.

137
00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:53.650
I¡¯ll finish it when I get home.

138
00:14:54.693 --> 00:15:00.598
In winter there it¡¯s white with snow
as far as you can see.

139
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.960
I want to set up my easel
in all that snow...

140
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:10.301
and finish the painting
while I¡¯m so cold it hurts.

141
00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:15.013
hi that pure white landscape..

142
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:20.311
you feel like you¡¯re on
some strange, distant world.

143
00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.258
I¡¯d love to go there.

144
00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:31.326
Yeah...

145
00:15:31.563 --> 00:15:37.263
To thank you, I¡¯ll invite you there
when peace comes.

146
00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.201
The full moon...

147
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.342
Not till tomorrow.

148
00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:52.909
But I like this moon best.

149
00:15:54.253 --> 00:15:57.279
After the full moon
it starts to wane.

150
00:15:57.823 --> 00:16:03.853
But with the 14th night,
there¡¯s still tomorrow...and hope.

151
00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.223
I have to leave.

152
00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.257
But you¡¯re hurt!

153
00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:17.805
My friends are fighting in Manchuria.
A paint¡ªbrush isn¡¯t much help, though.

154
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:27.715
This? It¡¯s the key to
the most important thing there is.

155
00:16:28.354 --> 00:16:30.345
The most important thing?

156
00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:32.512
Guess.

157
00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:41.763
I don¡¯t know. But don¡¯t tell me.
Give me till tomorrow.

158
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:42.999
Promise?

159
00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.246
Tell usl

160
00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.915
You¡¯re in love with someonel

161
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.949
First Iove

162
00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:03.716


163
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:13.028
Isn¡¯t that sweet!

164
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.100
Even old people were young once.

165
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.964
Isn¡¯t that the key you brought her?

166
00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:09.450
He can¡¯t have gone far
Keep looking!

167
00:18:18.697 --> 00:18:20.528
Mis&

168
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:26.030
Thank heavens you¡¯re all rightl
There was a thief in the storerooml

169
00:18:26.572 --> 00:18:29.040
He¡¯s OK. He made it to the station.

170
00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:32.070
I¡¯m so glad you¡¯re not hurt!

171
00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.771
The Chief Clerk! Yes!

172
00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.773
This is hard work!

173
00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.443
Wait

174
00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:40.877
Wait

175
00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.172
Wait!

176
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:45.582
Wait!

177
00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:57.993
I¡¯ll come!

178
00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.629
I¡¯ll come to you!

179
00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:08.703
Now that¡¯s drama!

180
00:20:13.445 --> 00:20:17.347
I cried 53 times at this scene¡¯

181
00:20:18.684 --> 00:20:20.811
When did this turn into a movie¡¯?

182
00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:27.154
That¡¯s when I started
making films.

183
00:20:27.559 --> 00:20:29.220
I see.

184
00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:32.095
How did that start?

185
00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:39.095
Well, you remember
the managing director said...

186
00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:42.238
his film was set in Manchuria...

187
00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.835
Manchijria Of cours&

188
00:20:47.613 --> 00:20:49.581
Thank you, Chiyoko.

189
00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:52.475
I knew you¡¯d say yesl

190
00:20:52.818 --> 00:20:56.015
Well, I should serve my country...

191
00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:57.717
shouldn¡¯t I?

192
00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:00.318
I see..

193
00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:04.018
You were just following that manl

194
00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:04.958
Yes!

195
00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.324
I didn¡¯t care about movies

196
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.789
Chiyoko

197
00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.873
Chiyoko¡¯s playing the title role.

198
00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.475
How do you do.

199
00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:20.407
I¡¯m sure you recognize...

200
00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:23.742
...Shimao Eiko, our biggest star...

201
00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.445
Hello, Chieko.

202
00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.066
Aren¡¯t we pensivel

203
00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.106
Hey!

204
00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.103
I know him!

205
00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.241
Give it back!

206
00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:59.014
Looks like Dad found me
an actress!

207
00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:03.377
WeII You work fast, ¡®sonny¡¯.

208
00:22:05.957 --> 00:22:08.619
¡®Chizuko¡¯, wasn¡¯t it?

209
00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:10.326
¡®Chiyoko.¡¯

210
00:22:10.996 --> 00:22:14.625
This is ¡®Mr Otaki¡¯,
the managing director¡¯s son.

211
00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:17.592
A promising young director.

212
00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:21.099
He loves auditioning actresses.

213
00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:26.069
Sorry. I shouldn¡¯t tease.

214
00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:29.676
Someone left it with me.

215
00:22:29.781 --> 00:22:33.842
If I see him in Manchuria,
I want to give it back.

216
00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:36.647
We¡¯re not going there for fun.

217
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:40.018
Who is he? What¡¯s his name?

218
00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:41.953
I don¡¯t know.

219
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.157
Then how will you find him?

220
00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:46.688
He paints.

221
00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:47.992
Paints what?

222
00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.461
I don¡¯t know.

223
00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.331
Not even that?

224
00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:53.201
But...

225
00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:57.241
I¡¯m sure he¡¯s in Manchurial

226
00:22:58.043 --> 00:23:01.171
Never heard of anyone like that.

227
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.210
I know this¡¯

228
00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:08.242
But I¡¯m sure he¡¯s around her&

229
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:11.618
I don¡¯t need amateurs
hanging around!

230
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.950
I¡¯m not leaving!

231
00:23:15.894 --> 00:23:17.725
I¡¯ve crossed a whole ocean...

232
00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:19.990
to get here, and...

233
00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:21.223


234
00:23:21.767 --> 00:23:22.961


235
00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:26.761
Director! What¡¯s going on here¡¯?¡¯

236
00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.700
This girl doesn¡¯t know her lines!

237
00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:31.866
OK, OK

238
00:23:34.112 --> 00:23:37.013
Once you¡¯ve made yourself
into your character...

239
00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:41.779
the lines will come welling up
naturally from inside.

240
00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:42.544
Yes, sir.

241
00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:46.589
I told you this was no role
for a rank amateurl

242
00:23:48.026 --> 00:23:51.928
1.1 just want to see him,
even oncel

243
00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:58.193
Great! Let¡¯s do a take!

244
00:24:00.038 --> 00:24:01.528
Well done.

245
00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:05.870
That was great.

246
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.238
You can act.

247
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.075
What¡¯s wrong with you?

248
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.542
So...any clues to the guy
who owns the key?

249
00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:20.320
You still haven¡¯t given up?

250
00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:25.093
Why not try a fortune¡ªteller?

251
00:24:26.298 --> 00:24:30.735
There¡¯s one near here
they say is very good.

252
00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:33.895
Divination

253
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.904
The man you seek
is in the north.

254
00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:44.414
He paints. He¡¯s tall.

255
00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:48.312
And would he happen
to be searching for a key?

256
00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:50.314
Do you know him?

257
00:24:54.593 --> 00:24:57.653
If that¡¯s the man...

258
00:24:57.963 --> 00:25:01.399
Tell mel Pleasel Where is he¡¯?¡¯

259
00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:17.838
Leaving the shoot?
That¡¯s unprofessionaI

260
00:25:18.116 --> 00:25:21.108
You just don¡¯t understand women.

261
00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:24.020
And you do?

262
00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:29.015
Mass Round¡ªUp Of Activists
In North Manchuria

263
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:36.025
But he¡¯s a lucky guy, if she¡¯s
willing to follow him this far.

264
00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:39.701
Would that it were me!

265
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.537
Chiyok&Chiyoko

266
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:49.872
Nationalists?

267
00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:51.015
Communists?

268
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.049
Look

269
00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.480

Where¡¯d the bandits go?!

276
00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:59.243
What¡¯s the meaning of this?!

277
00:26:59.484 --> 00:27:01.679
That¡¯s what I¡¯d like to knowl

278
00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:05.247
Where did Manchuria go¡¯?l

279
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:16.724
Your Highnes&

280
00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:17.993
Where is he?

281
00:27:18.236 --> 00:27:20.227
Milord is in the castl&

282
00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:23.907
Your Highnes&You mustn¡¯t!

283
00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.159
Milord!

284
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.660
Milord!

285
00:27:50.568 --> 00:27:53.731
Why would you not wait for me?l

286
00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:57.641

You cried at aH her films?

288
00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.485

Wraithl Do you haunt this castle?

290
00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.809
Call me what you will.

291
00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:47.185
Since before you were born
I have known you.

292
00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.417
What do you wish?

293
00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:54.692
To assist at my death?

294
00:28:58.069 --> 00:29:00.503
Drink

295
00:29:01.773 --> 00:29:08.872
What may not be in this world
will be in the next.

296
00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:12.711
So I must die...

297
00:29:13.318 --> 00:29:16.549
There he awaits.

298
00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:49.918
That is Thousand¡ªYear Tea¡¯

299
00:29:50.121 --> 00:29:55.423
Now you will burn forever
in the flames of eternal lovel

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.814
I will not leave Milord.

309

Wraith Be damned

310
00:31:10.835 --> 00:31:15.295
I regret to say Milord
has been taken captive.

May fortune be yoursl

323
00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.547
It seems like yesterday.

324
00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:39.089
You don¡¯t mind?

325
00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:45.023
Not at all, Miss Fujiwaral
Any way you like.

326
00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.893
Thank you.

327
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:51.826
Where was I?

328
00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:54.562
Breaking through the enemy...

329
00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:57.264
Where Nagato gets stabbed.

330
00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:58.704
Oh, yes...

331
00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:04.112
If he was a prisoner,
I just had to help him somehow.

332
00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:36.046
What the...¡¯?l

333
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.704
Villainy¡¯

334
00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.810
Guard the prisonerl

335
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.485
I¡¯m here to save you

336
00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:50.419
You¡¯ll never get the better of mel

337
00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:59.462
Could a princess do that?

338
00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:14.449
Behind you¡¯

339
00:34:19.957 --> 00:34:21.356
Finish her off!

340

Wait.

341
00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.457
Who are you¡¯?

342
00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:30.427
Give me a break

343
00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:37.431
My name is of no importance.

344
00:34:38.309 --> 00:34:40.834
You¡¯ You followed mel

345
00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.908
Cut him down¡¯

346
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.915
I¡¯m good at being stubborn.

347
00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.326
Why do you care about me?

348
00:34:57.428 --> 00:35:00.295
I can¡¯t help it. I like you.

349
00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:06.294
The same reason you insist
on going to save him.

350
00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:10.033
But I love himl

351
00:35:10.408 --> 00:35:12.876
Stop talking and go.

352
00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.971
Leave this fight to me.

353
00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:19.343
I don¡¯t need any thanks.

354
00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:24.253
I¡¯ve always thought
I¡¯d like to die...

355
00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:27.714
for the woman I loved.

356
00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:30.851
Maybe I should
get myself fired...

357
00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:35.131

I¡¯m coming!

363
00:36:10.568 --> 00:36:14.095
By now his head¡¯s on display
in the capitaP

364
00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.330
Kyoto¡¯?

365
00:36:16.607 --> 00:36:19.701
For you, the road ends here

366
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.911
He¡¯s in Kyoto!

367
00:36:32.924 --> 00:36:33.652
Have pityl

368
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.056
No! I won¡¯t let you go!

369
00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.958
I¡¯ll come back

370
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.596
I just want to see him
and give him what¡¯s his

371
00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.565
How nice of you

372
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:51.604
A man about to be executed
is n need of notHng now.

373
00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.905
You poor fooll

374
00:36:56.514 --> 00:37:00.848
Pursue him as long
and as far as you may...

375
00:37:01.085 --> 00:37:03.110
you cannot escape your fate.

376
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:07.054
Neither you, nor her!

377
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.957
Don¡¯t just stand there! Bring her!

378
00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.258
On your feet!

379
00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:18.660
Let me go! Please! Let me go!

380
00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:21.361
I must go to him!

381
00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:24.598
I promise I¡¯ll come back!
Let me go!

382
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:29.807
Now we¡¯re in Kyoto...faster than
a speeding bullet train!

383
00:37:31.415 --> 00:37:32.643
Another age, too..

384
00:37:34.385 --> 00:37:36.114
Torakich!

385
00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:40.483
Where¡¯s Chiyoko¡¯?

386
00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:45.219
You¡¯re not dressed for this era.

387
00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.502
Don¡¯t you glare at m&

388
00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:02.037
I taught you everything you know,
and now you¡¯ve shamed m&

389
00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:04.507
You¡¯ll learn to listen to reason!

390
00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:09.180
The fool! Making Eiko mad!

391
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.484
It serves her right
Chiyo doesn¡¯t know her place.

392
00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:17.025
A few men like her
and she thinks she¡¯s a geishal

393
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.727
Watch her! Make sure
she doesn¡¯t run sway again!

394
00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:32.542
Wasn¡¯t this supposed to be
a documentary¡¯?

395
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.741
Damn right!

396
00:38:34.912 --> 00:38:39.906
The Seven Specters:
The Legend of Fujiwara Chiyoko¡¯!

397
00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:45.616
Old people these days!

398
00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:52.688
Are you all right, Miss?

399
00:38:54.298 --> 00:38:56.129
I¡¯m fine.

400
00:38:57.001 --> 00:38:59.492
Leave this to me.

401
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.197
Come this way.

402
00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:08.410
He¡¯s in the city, isn¡¯t he?

403
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:14.876
Surely you don¡¯t think
I¡¯d keep you locked in here!

404
00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:17.579
I won¡¯t forget this!

405
00:39:17.955 --> 00:39:24.884
When you first came here,
I felt I knew you already.

406
00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:30.761
And I thought that some day
I¡¯d like to help you.

407
00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:34.302
And ever since then...

408
00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:37.504
Chiyok&

409
00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:40.310
Pay attention!

410
00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.340
A jailbreak¡¯?!

411
00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:50.511
Some rebel samurai got away!

412
00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.366
Spread out!

413
00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:15.677
Sorry.

414
00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:25.549
It¡¯s m&Don¡¯t you remember¡¯?

415
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.391
We met on a winter¡¯s day,
just like thisl

416
00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:38.092
I¡¯ve searched and searched
for youl

417
00:40:43.073 --> 00:40:45.064
To give this back to you...

418
00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:47.973
Go around that way!
Don¡¯t let any escape!

419
00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.377
Wait!

420
00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:51.645
Your key!

421
00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:59.256
Keep it will we meet.

422
00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:06.055
Over there! Hurry!

423
00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:16.063
You saw a samurai
run past here, didn¡¯t you.

424
00:41:17.208 --> 00:41:18.573
Where did he go?

425
00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:23.977
That way.

426
00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.944
I¡¯ve seen you before...

427
00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:36.985
You¡¯re hiding something.

428
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.990
Tell us. You know
which way he went.

429
00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:49.337
Whoops!

430
00:41:50.741 --> 00:41:54.006
Have no fear, Miss.

431
00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.837
And here he comes at last!

432
00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:01.383
You¡¯re a damned
anti¡ªgovernment rebel!

433
00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:05.916
And you¡¯re fools who don¡¯t know
when your time has gone.

434
00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:23.704
Get on, Miss...

435
00:42:24.675 --> 00:42:27.235
and leave the reat to...

436
00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:16.589
Be carefull You¡¯ll strain yourself!

437
00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:19.490
Such kindness to a humble man!

438
00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:24.289
Miss! I¡¯ll never forget..

439
00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:48.648
Playing truant, are we?

440
00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:54.053
Off to meet a certain
¡®human¡ªrights¡¯ agitator?

441
00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.922
I don¡¯t understand...

442
00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.728
We have proof

443
00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:04.564
He left you a little memento
on your etoreroom wall.

444
00:44:04.842 --> 00:44:06.537
He did?l

445
00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:08.874
So you do know him.

446
00:44:09.513 --> 00:44:13.711
That¡¯s all I need to know.
We¡¯ll continue at the station.

447
00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:16.517
You can tell us everything there.

448
00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:39.030
Another stubborn onel

449
00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:44.478
Tell them what they want to know.

450
00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.676
I can¡¯t tell them what I don¡¯t know.

451
00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:55.418
But I wouldn¡¯t tell them
even if I knew.

452
00:44:56.326 --> 00:44:59.784
I¡¯d never betray him!

453
00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:05.127
You little fool!

454
00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:09.034
That¡¯s what you say now...

455
00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.741
But feelings change.

456
00:45:12.142 --> 00:45:17.045
I won¡¯t be like thatl
I love him more every dayl

457
00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:23.281
Everyone¡¯s like that.

458
00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:29.948
They say Elko gave her man
all the money she¡¯d earned!

459
00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:33.129
Then he ran off with someone els&

460
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:39.496
I wish she¡¯d pass some my way

461
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.038
Huh?

462
00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.244
Now what?

463
00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:55.841
Miss I¡¯m here to save yo&

464
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.076
Who are you?

465
00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:00.053
Have you forgotten?

466
00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:04.718
I¡¯m Gen the rickshaw man
I¡¯ve come, just as I promised...

467
00:46:04.995 --> 00:46:08.328
to repay your kindness!

468
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.407
Am I really being set free?

469
00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.373
Didn¡¯t I say you would be¡¯?

470
00:46:23.714 --> 00:46:27.878
We don¡¯t need you any more.
We caught the guy.

471
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:48.499
Wait Pleas&

472
00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.340
Wait Pleas&

473
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:02.841
Open the door

474
00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:07.857
Pleas&I just want to see him once

475
00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:12.494
Please! Open the door!

476
00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:16.255
Please! Open the door!

477
00:47:28.645 --> 00:47:30.340
What¡¯s next?

478
00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:58.841
What is this? Science¡ªfiction?

479
00:47:59.009 --> 00:47:59.873
IdioV

480
00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:08.147
Is this your idea of gratitude?

481
00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:11.817
But the storehouse is on fire!

482
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:18.655
You little fool! What makes you
think you can just die too?!

483
00:48:19.429 --> 00:48:20.225
Chiyo

484
00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:21.058
Chiyo

485
00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:24.394
Chiyoko, come back!

486
00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:25.660
Hurry!

487
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:27.632
Chiyok&

488
00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:29.068
Get back her&

489
00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:30.673
Come on¡¯

490
00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:01.804
Wisteria Sweets

491
00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.753
I know this¡¯

492
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:10.631
Some day, for sure.

493
00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.264
Chiyoko

494
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:47.207
Chiyoko

495
00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.002
Chiyoko!

496
00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:50.840
Are you all right?!

497
00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:52.939
Chiyok&

498
00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:55.414
Chiyok&

499
00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:56.914
Chiyoko

500
00:51:08.932 --> 00:51:11.400
You cannot escape...

501
00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:15.035
You cannot escap&

502
00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.915
Are you aU right?

503
00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:42.059
Are you feeling ill?

504
00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:45.301
I¡¯m fine. If you listen to doctors...

505
00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:48.363
you think that old people
are always sick.

506
00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:54.368
We¡¯ll come back another day.

507
00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:55.238
No.

508
00:51:56.046 --> 00:52:00.312
By tomorrow I won¡¯t remember...

509
00:52:07.157 --> 00:52:11.560
After the war, it was all
we could do to survive.

510
00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:15.764
We had no food, no clothes...

511
00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.959
Wanting to make good films
was all that kept us going.

512
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.067
Every single day was busy.

513
00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:35.784
But I always believed
that some day..

514
00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:41.549
we¡¯d meet again.

515
00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:46.193
The world had changed,
and I had no idea how to find him...

516
00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.497
there was always the chance...

517
00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:54.864
he¡¯ll see one of my films.

518
00:52:57.073 --> 00:53:01.271
Yes, the mid¡ª50s were
the peak of your career...

519
00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:06.975
Huh¡¯?

520
00:53:08.818 --> 00:53:09.910
Now you know.

521
00:53:10.554 --> 00:53:16.015
You were at Ginei?
In the Otaki unit?

522
00:53:16.726 --> 00:53:19.217
Uh, yes, but in
far too minor a position...

523
00:53:19.362 --> 00:53:22.525
for you to have noticed me.

524
00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:25.528
You should have told me!

525
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:28.034
Well, you know...

526
00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:33.107
.1 was never a director
or even a crew chief.

527
00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:36.245
And I was always getting
Mr Otaki angry.

528
00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:43.077
Tachibana Genya.
I-low do you do.

529
00:53:46.856 --> 00:53:48.585
Do a good job.

530
00:53:49.226 --> 00:53:52.093
Eiko, this is Genya,
a new apprentice.

531
00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:57.097
I¡¯ve always loved the dialogue
between you and Fujiwara Chiyoko.

532
00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.300
Yes, I set her off very well.

533
00:54:05.442 --> 00:54:08.411
Never mention Chiyoko to her!

534
00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.840
Remember one thing:

535
00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:16.344
In this business we flatter both
the audience and the actresses.

536
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.783
I¡¯ll show you one of these days.

537
00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.288
Uh..yes, sir.

538
00:54:28.198 --> 00:54:32.066
Well, I certainly fell for it.

539
00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:53.881
A film director is a lot like
a painter, Chiyoko.

540
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:58.449
A painter puts the colors he likes
on a canvas.

541
00:54:59.296 --> 00:55:02.788
And I¡¯ve found a great color
for my canvas.

542
00:55:04.234 --> 00:55:05.826
That color is you.

543
00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.740
He seduced her
with a line like that?

544
00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.548
I should try that one...

545
00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:40.069
Im sorry

546
00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:51.874
Bastard

547
00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.325
Sorry.

548
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:25.042
Fujiwara Chiyoka
The Madonna¡¯

549
00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:29.911
I¡¯m hom&

550
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:37.053
I told you to tell them no¡¯

551
00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:44.065
You won¡¯t be everyone¡¯s
madonna¡¯ forever, you know

552
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:47.067
A woman¡¯s happiness
comes from making a hom&

553
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.033
But I¡¯ve got...

554
00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:54.566
All the thought criminals
have long been set free.

555
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:57.846
He hasn¡¯t even come to see you¡¯

556
00:56:57.947 --> 00:56:58.606
N&

557
00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:00.309
I¡¯m going to him

558
00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:03.586
You don¡¯t know if he¡¯s
alive or dead

559
00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:07.152
Hes alive¡¯ I know it!

560
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.123
You won¡¯t be young forever!

561
00:57:10.226 --> 00:57:13.423
We promised to meet some day!

562
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.699
You¡¯re too old for these
little¡ªgirl dreams!

563
00:57:26.342 --> 00:57:27.434
Cut!

564
00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:33.978
What¡¯s wrong, Chyoko?

565
00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.712
Here we go again I¡¯m tired.

566
00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:40.588
The old lady wants a break.

567
00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.749
Take five¡¯

568
00:57:58.942 --> 00:57:59.966
Its gone¡¯

569
00:58:02.745 --> 00:58:06.237
Ye&This is the day it happened

570
00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:11.752
Miss Eiko

571
00:58:13.356 --> 00:58:14.618
Is it lunch time?

572
00:58:14.958 --> 00:58:16.858
Not yet.

573
00:58:17.494 --> 00:58:19.792
Genya, get out to the stage.

574
00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:22.295
The princess is not amused.

575
00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:27.493
Please¡¯ Look everywher&

576
00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:29.928
I have to have it

577
00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:37.174
Don¡¯t just stand there¡¯ Get Iooking

578
00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.804
Yes, sir

579
00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.077
Looking for what?

580
00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.620
Chiyoko¡¯s key¡¯

581
00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:52.324
So Eiko took it...

582
00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:55.924
No one knew that then.

583
00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:59.828
And we couldn¡¯t find it anywhere.

584
00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:03.495
It didn¡¯t get up and walk awayl
It¡¯s here somewherel

585
00:59:04.407 --> 00:59:07.376
What¡¯s it the key to, Chiyoko?

586
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.999
Yeah

587
00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:09.201
I¡¯d like to know!

588
00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:10.242
Me, too!

589
00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:12.211
Tell us, Missl

590
00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:20.446
Someone very dear to me
gave it to me to keep.

591
00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:23.292
Your boyfriend?

592
00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.415
Her steady!

593
00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:25.653
I wonder what he¡¯s Iike

594
00:59:25.828 --> 00:59:26.692
What¡¯s he like?

595
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.056
Is he handsome?

596
00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:29.296
What did he look like...

597
00:59:29.432 --> 00:59:31.525
Like an actor?

598
00:59:31.701 --> 00:59:33.168
Who does he look like?

599
00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:35.004
Who...

600
00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.710
I can¡¯t remember

601
00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:45.406
Not even his face

602
00:59:53.957 --> 00:59:56.755
I loved him so much!

603
00:59:57.126 --> 01:00:00.562
Now I cant remember his fac&

604
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.776
I¡¯m sorry.

605
01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.434
Not at all.

606
01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:19.874
This tea has a wonderful aroma.

607
01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:25.243
It¡¯s herb tea from my garden.
It¡¯s very good for you.

608
01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.324
Shall we continue?

609
01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:37.898
Soon after the key disappeared,
you got married...

610
01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.898
Yes, to Otaki.

611
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:48.103
It was as if I¡¯d lost
part of my heart with that key.

612
01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:53.742
And I was too old
to be dreaming any more.

613
01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:59.386
Yesterday, the 20th,
at 1147p.m. Japan time..

614
01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:03.055
seven American astronauts..

615
01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:05.558
were launched into space
from Cape Cana vera!.

616
01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:12.893
As the world watched the rocket
achieved orbit in five minutes.

617
01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:19.699
Darn

618
01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.821
Well, now she knows.

619
01:02:08.224 --> 01:02:10.658
Eiko What does this mean?

620
01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:13.957
A farce by a great director...

621
01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:17.231
to win a popular actress.

622
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:21.993
And silly me took the role
of the thief.

623
01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.268
But...

624
01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:29.135
I¡¯ve always had
a guilty conscience about you.

625
01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.775
That fortune¡ªteller...

626
01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:34.178
was a dirty trick.

627
01:02:36.552 --> 01:02:38.520
It was wrong.

628
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.790
But I would have done anything
to get rid of you.

629
01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:44.250
Did you know where he was?

630
01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:46.792
How would I know?

631
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:52.324
But a certain someone
found out about my trick.

632
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.173
What did I ever do to you?

633
01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.135
I was jealous!

634
01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:05.908
Of your youth!

635
01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:11.686
And how chasing after one man
kept you young!

636
01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:16.956
And I got stuck playing the
older woman you¡¯d run up against.

637
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:21.195
Now I¡¯ve lost even
the energy to hate you any more.

638
01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:24.925
Isn¡¯t this all far in the past?

639
01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:30.769
Urn...

640
01:03:31.841 --> 01:03:34.469
We¡¯re in a meeting. Come back later.

641
01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:40.809
There¡¯s someone here
to see Miss Chiyoko.

642
01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:58.664
You¡¯re Miss Fujiwara Chiyoko,
aren¡¯t you.

643
01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.302
What do you want now?

644
01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:10.341
I¡¯m sorry...you know me, then,
don¡¯t you.

645
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.247
Go away¡¯

646
01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:19.046
I¡¯m sure you hate me.

647
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:24.954
I was as evil as those I served
in their abuse of power.

648
01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:28.456
I am on a journey of atonement...

649
01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.960
for my sins before the war.

650
01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:36.465
A painter we held for
thought crimes left you this.

651
01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:42.340
He said he was in your debt,
and wanted to thank you.

652
01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.615
I am most truly sorry.

653
01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.333
Chiyoko

654
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:32.156
It bothers me that
I was not able to thank you.

655
01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.660
¡®I want to see you, but this war...

656
01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:39.095
.grows more intense by the day.

657
01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:44.933
¡®When the war is over,
and real peace has come...

658
01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:51.207
¡®.1 will go home to Hokkaido
and finish that painting.

659
01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.682
¡®Some day I¡¯d like to show you
that starry, a tarry sky..

660
01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.861
.as I promised I would.¡¯

661
01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.634
This?

662
01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.967
It¡¯s the key to
the most important thing there is.

663
01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.105
The most important thing?

664
01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:26.474
Give me t,If tomorrow.

665
01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:27.911
Promise?

666
01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:51.567
Last call for the 1937
Snow and Sky Express¡¯..

667
01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:56.607
now boarding on Platform 12.

Tell us!

669
01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.852
You¡¯re in love with someone!

670
01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:08.753
First love!

671
01:07:10.926 --> 01:07:12.325
Not ti/I tomorrow.

672

and hope.

674

Bandits again?

675
01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:27.403
Idiot

676
01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:33.838
A tten f/on passengers..

677
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:40.216
This train will stop temporarily
due to a rock slide on the tracks.

678
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.781
Open the door!

679
01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:48.127
There are buses comingl

680
01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:51.597
Train staff will conduct you
down to the highwayl

681
01:08:07.049 --> 01:08:09.483
You poor fool!

682
01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:13.553
You cannot escape your fate.

683
01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:17.890
You will burn forever
in the f/ames of eternal love!

684
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.488
Kyoto?!

685
01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.189
I will go to him!

686
01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:23.365
Waif!

687

Wait!

688

Keep it till we meet.

689
01:08:37.279 --> 01:08:38.405
Have pity!

690
01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:42.917
He¡¯s alive! I know it!

691
01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:44.518
I¡¯m going to him!

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:48.082
I love him more every day!

You don¡¯t look like you¡¯re out

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.463
Move that stuff!

723
01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:34.666
Chiyok&

724
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.132
Everyore heIp

725
01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:36.963
Quick

726
01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.469
Chiyok&

727
01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.506
Hurry

728
01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.643
She¡¯s her&And Geny&

729
01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:46.974
Are you all right?!

730
01:14:56.725 --> 01:14:57.657
Ow!

731
01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:00.795
Did you shield me?

732
01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:02.793
Yes.

733
01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.727
Way to go, Genya!

734
01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.529
I hate you

735
01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:14.665
And I love youl
More than I can bear

736
01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:19.010
Chiyokol

737
01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.444
Chiyoko, what¡¯s wrong?

738
01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.573
Chiyok&

739
01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:25.780
Genya, what did you do?!

740
01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.544
Nothing!

741
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:46.239
Imagine forgetting someone
who saved my lifel

742
01:15:46.408 --> 01:15:50.105
No.1 look different now.

743
01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:57.449
It¡¯s been 30 years...
I¡¯ve lived quietly since then.

744
01:16:00.022 --> 01:16:01.853
Why did you do it?

745
01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:08.227
After you vanished in Hokkaido,
you went back to films.

746
01:16:08.463 --> 01:16:10.556
After that studio accident...

747
01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:15.765
why did you go into hiding?

748
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:39.358
I never thought I¡¯d see him again,
even though...

749
01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:42.324
.d resolved...

750
01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.597
...to follow him anywhere.

751
01:16:46.935 --> 01:16:48.869
So then why?

752
01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:53.597
After the accident,
I realized something.

753
01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:58.806
I wasn¡¯t the girl
he¡¯d remember any more.

754
01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:04.217
I hate youl

755
01:17:05.253 --> 01:17:07.687
More than I car bearl

756
01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:14.822
I didn¡¯t want him
to see me old.

757
01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:36.551
Chiyoko?

758
01:17:42.858 --> 01:17:44.086
It¡¯s a big one¡¯

759
01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.088
Chiyokol

760
01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:59.704
You¡¯re always there to help me...

761
01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.645
Chiyok&Chiyoko

762
01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.440
In the end...

763
01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:40.738
she never met
the guy who gave her the key.

764
01:18:42.851 --> 01:18:44.512
That old policeman...

765
01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.558
That painter...

766
01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:59.858
refused to talk, right to the end.
So I tortured him.

767
01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.837
I kiNed him.

768
01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.266
So Chiyoko...

769
01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:13.375
was just chasing a shadow.

770
01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:50.251
I¡¯m sorry! We asked
too much of you.

771
01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:55.216
No.1 enjoyed it very much.

772
01:19:56.057 --> 01:19:59.220
But I guess this is goodbye.

773
01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.962
The doctor says you¡¯Ii be fine¡¯

774
01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:05.723
You¡¯re a poor liar, aren¡¯t you.

775
01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:11.267
Don¡¯t feel sad.

776
01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.775
After all, I¡¯m going...

777
01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:18.776
after that man again.

778
01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:27.216
See? I have the key,
thanks to you.

779
01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:32.223
It¡¯s opened the door
to my memories of him.

780
01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:36.759
It¡¯s as if while
I was talking to you...

781
01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:41.226
the girl I was
came back to life.

782
01:20:43.605 --> 01:20:48.235
This time you¡¯ll find him.
I¡¯m sure of it!

783
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:50.605
I wonder...

784
01:20:51.346 --> 01:20:55.282
But maybe it doesn¡¯t matter.

785
01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.316
After all...

786
01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:08.689
After all, it¡¯s the chasing after him
I really love.
