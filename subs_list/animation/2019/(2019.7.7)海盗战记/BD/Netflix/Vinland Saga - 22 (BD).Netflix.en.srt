1
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,560
Forgive me!

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,930
I missed your heart.

3
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,270
I'll end it quickly!

4
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,810
Askeladd.

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,860
I wanted to be your friend.

6
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,950
Yes, Bjorn.

7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
You…

8
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,160
were my only…

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,080
true friend.

10
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,760
Send me off.

11
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,700
Now then.

12
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,530
Sorry to keep you waiting, kid.

13
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,540
Come.

14
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll play with you.

15
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,220
Like rowing a boat,
we enter the future backwards.

16
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,630
All we see are the scenes of the past,

17
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,140
and no one can not see
the views of tomorrow.

18
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,650
EPISODE 22: LONE WOLF

19
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,200
Damn it.

20
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,530
He's different from usual.

21
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,920
So, who do you think will win, Prince?

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,090
Want to bet on it?

23
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,420
It doesn't matter who wins.

24
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,970
I'll stop it before either dies.

25
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,050
How could you say a thing like that?

26
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,100
A duel between two master swordsmen
is not something you see every day.

27
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,020
In that case,

28
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,100
who do you believe
is stronger between them?

29
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,610
Me?

30
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,320
Let's see…

31
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,110
Askeladd, I guess.

32
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,200
I'd bet one pound of silver on him.

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,530
I'm not betting.

34
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,820
Why do you think so?

35
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,450
That's the impression I get from his aura?

36
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
Thorfinn managed to beat you.

37
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,250
Is Askeladd even stronger?

38
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,840
Little prince, are you mocking me?

39
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,180
Between the three of us,
there's no way I'd be the weakest. Got it?

40
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,100
It's not just a matter
of who's stronger or weaker.

41
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,230
It's interesting because there is
no measuring who will win or lose.

42
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,360
I'm not interested.

43
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,650
You really are a girl.

44
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,280
What's wrong, Thorfinn?

45
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,620
Attack me.

46
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,250
Let's finish this before more snow falls.

47
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,880
Guess you leave me no choice.

48
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,220
There. This will should simply things.

49
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,640
Come on, brat.

50
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,870
See?

51
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,170
You still don't get it do you?
Why it always ends like this?

52
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,850
I stand corrected.
This isn't a duel at all.

53
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,730
Askeladd knows all Thorfinn's tendencies.
He sees right through him.

54
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,530
They have fought quite a few times.

55
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,240
I wonder what the reason is.

56
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,700
I don't know.

57
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,330
I didn't ask.

58
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,370
Good grief.

59
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,960
This kid never learns.

60
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,300
Did you get cocky after beating Thorkell?

61
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,100
I'm getting sick and tired of this.

62
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,440
Stop! That's enough!

63
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,440
You really thought
you could beat me with one arm?

64
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,820
Good God.

65
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,030
I sure am having a wonderful day.

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,290
Stop!

67
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,880
That's enough!

68
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
He's unconscious.

69
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,380
You've won.

70
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,510
Are you serious?

71
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,390
Thorfinn.

72
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,010
Hey, Thorfinn.

73
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,230
You understand?

74
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,150
The duel is over.

75
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,940
You lost.

76
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,370
Stop. It's over.

77
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,290
You bastard!

78
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,000
You lost consciousness.

79
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,540
He could have ended you.

80
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,130
Duel again once your arm heals.

81
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,300
That won't change anything.

82
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,550
The arm's not the problem.

83
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,680
That fool lost because he's an idiot.

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,190
Normally, you think when you're fighting.

85
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,900
But you screw it all up
when you lose your temper.

86
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,450
I can tell by your gaze
that you're aiming for my jugular.

87
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,330
You rage, shriek like a madman,

88
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,370
and wave your daggers like an amateur.

89
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,000
How tiresome it is.
Not one of you has a shred of beauty.

90
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,300
It's just as Bjorn said.

91
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,760
I hate warriors.

92
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,980
Especially you Norse warriors,
you Vikings.

93
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,900
The first person I killed
was a Norse warrior.

94
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,070
And he too was devoid of beauty.

95
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,280
That man was my father.

96
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,240
Boy.

97
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,500
For future reference, I will tell you…

98
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,750
how to properly kill

99
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,210
the man you despise.

100
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,730
-Oh, this is hot.
-I'm getting too old for this.

101
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,900
Watch out.

102
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,780
My mother was a slave.

103
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,330
My mother was sick, so she couldn't work.

104
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:16,500
As far back as I can remember,
I worked with a blacksmith in stables.

105
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,180
I was always covered
in ash, soot, or horse shit,

106
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,220
turning me black and white.

107
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,140
So they called me "Askeladd."

108
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,310
It means "covered in ash."

109
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,270
Lord Olaf has returned home!

110
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,230
He was victorious once again!

111
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,700
My father came from
a powerful Jutland family.

112
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,000
-Lord Olaf!
-Welcome home, Lord Olaf!

113
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,710
He liked booze, women, and killing.

114
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,960
He was as typical a Viking
as they come.

115
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,470
He had many other children like me
born to other women.

116
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,600
But he only gave names
to his older children born to his wife.

117
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:17,480
He probably didn't know
the faces of his other children.

118
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,490
When my mother was young,

119
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,860
she seemed to be
my father's favorite slave.

120
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,870
But when she fell ill,
he treated her no better than a dog.

121
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:36,870
I understood then
that life was full of strife.

122
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,090
But somehow,
my mother still maintained hope.

123
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,840
My mother often spoke of our ancestor,
the hero Artorius.

124
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,260
She told the same story countless times.

125
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,560
It was the legend of the general
who protected my mother's homeland

126
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,770
from a barbarian invasion 500 years ago.

127
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,780
She believed in the legend
of that hero's return.

128
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,030
That someday he would return
to free her from sickness and slavery.

129
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,120
She repeated it so many times
that I began to believe it myself.

130
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,710
She said that beyond the far west,

131
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:27,170
there was a perfect place,
that no ordinary person could reach.

132
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,300
The hero Artorius lived in that paradise.

133
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,900
It was a promised land

134
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,980
of peace and abundance,
where no one aged or died.

135
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,780
Supposedly, that hero is still there
tending to his battle wounds.

136
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,040
Someday, he will return to lead the army
that will vanquish the barbarians.

137
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,920
And he will rule over the world.

138
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,710
My mother's people
continue to wait for that day.

139
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,090
They have been waiting for 500 years.

140
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,640
But their hero

141
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,100
has yet to appear.

142
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,150
But think about it.

143
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,940
If my ancestor was truly living
in a such a wonderful place,

144
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,950
he would never give that up
to come back to this world.

145
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,370
And then,

146
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,540
when I was 11 years old,
my mother's spirit finally broke.

147
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,890
Mother!

148
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,730
Of all people,

149
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,070
my father happened to be passing by,
and she decided he was the hero Artorius.

150
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,960
I realized at that moment…

151
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,590
that if Artorius did not appear then
to save my mother,

152
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,310
he would never appear for all eternity.

153
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,520
Do you understand, boys?

154
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,690
Somebody must do it.

155
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,190
It won't be a hero or a god,

156
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,070
but somebody else.

157
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,370
It was a mysterious thing.

158
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,050
It was my first time using a sword,
but holding it felt natural.

159
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,800
I instinctively knew how to wield it.

160
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,140
It seemed proof that I had
that bastard's blood flowing in me.

161
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,390
It was a sad spectacle.

162
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,390
It pains me to this day.

163
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,110
You.

164
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,410
Are you that woman's child?

165
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,500
Are you my child?

166
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

167
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,470
You have promise.

168
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,230
You will live in my home.

169
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,480
I certainly didn't think
that an 11-year-old could kill him.

170
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,610
But the first step
was to get his attention.

171
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,530
This I had accomplished.

172
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,120
At his manor, I refined my etiquette.

173
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,580
I learned the arts
of swordsmanship and equestrianism.

174
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,920
I also got along well
with my older half-brothers.

175
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,840
-Well done, Askeladd.
-Not bad at all.

176
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,850
I was always careful
to show respect to my father.

177
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,070
I was his faithful son.

178
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,200
I never forgot
that he saved me from slavehood.

179
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,040
Before long, his servants and men
completely accepted me as his son.

180
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,840
I lived like that for two years.

181
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,400
I was waiting for two things,

182
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:39,070
a moment when he'd be careless
and the rights to his inheritance.

183
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,160
I wish you boys
could see the look on his face.

184
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,290
My father's face asking, "Why?"

185
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,000
I used my older brother's sword.

186
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,720
I stole it from a son
who didn't get along with him.

187
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,840
The other brothers
believed he was the murder.

188
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,810
So they hung him from the bough of tree,

189
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,850
the simple, naive fools.

190
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,230
They were all stupid and obscene,

191
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,520
a horde of crude barbarians
who knew nothing but greed.

192
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:25,030
Ugly bastards like that
sprung out from every place I looked

193
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,780
and made their presence known.

194
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,660
I could have never killed them all.

195
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,670
It doesn't matter if it's Artorius,
Ragnarok, or the Last Judgment.

196
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,420
But if something is coming,
I wish it would hurry up.

197
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,850
Well, when that day comes,
I probably won't survive it.

198
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,810
I've rambled for too long.

199
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,690
To put it simply, Thorfinn…

200
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,440
since you've failed to defeat me
over these past ten years

201
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
you are an idiot.

202
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,410
Shut up!

203
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,490
No matter what happens, I will kill you!

204
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,460
I swear I will kill you!

205
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,010
Good grief.

206
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,050
You still say that
after what I just told you?

207
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,930
You're like a dog chasing his own tail.

208
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,600
I respect
your determination and work ethic.

209
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,570
All I've had to do is agree
to these ridiculous duels,

210
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,650
and you've eagerly gone off
to challenge even Thorkell.

211
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,320
What a useful brat
you've been all these years.

212
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,000
Goodness.

213
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,670
I should be grateful to Thors too.

214
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,550
Wait.

215
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,220
Wait!

216
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,060
Enough already.

217
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,640
Shut up!

218
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:18,060
Keep your mouth shut!

219
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,020
Heal your wounds.

220
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,940
Wait.

221
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,490
Just stop!

222
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,580
Pathetic.

223
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,960
Good grief.

224
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,800
You're stiff as a board now, Bjorn.

225
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,180
Wait.

226
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
Why me?

227
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,020
You're the descendant of a hero, Askeladd.

228
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,820
And you're wise.

229
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,610
Don't you think that if you were king,
you could change the world?

230
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,450
That's hilarious.

231
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,870
Didn't you hear my story?

232
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,710
You are more suited for the throne.

233
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,880
More than me or King Sweyn.

234
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,840
I can tell by your face.

235
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,810
I am but a Viking.

236
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
