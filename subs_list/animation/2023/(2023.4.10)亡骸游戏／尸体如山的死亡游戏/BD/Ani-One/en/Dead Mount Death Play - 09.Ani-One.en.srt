1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,620
There's no reason to be so wary of us.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,520
Although I would like to say that

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,380
we are here to inquire about
the fire accident from yesterday,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,270
in fact, I am here for personal reasons.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,350
It's just lunchtime,

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,090
and I thought of doing divination.

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,120
Are you going to give it a try, Arase?

8
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,490
I'm not really interested in such things.

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,700
If I get the result, "Quit your job as a
police officer because you have bad luck,"

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,720
wouldn't that make
things difficult for me?

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,100
You are still as troublesome as ever.

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,040
Well, then, why don't you do
divination for me alone?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,230
Alright.

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Please go to the room next door.

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,980
Okay, it's over here.

16
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,580
Please follow me.

17
00:00:54,663 --> 00:00:59,904
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

18
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,952
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

19
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:17,778
But speaking of which, as a student,
you have become a diviner.

20
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:19,088
Although there is nothing wrong with that,

21
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:21,738
your business application must be
submitted within a month per regulations.

22
00:02:22,718 --> 00:02:24,978
That's all for routine matters.

23
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:28,498
Young man, there is something
I want to ask you for help with.

24
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:33,088
Please guide poor police officers like us.

25
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:36,898
I'm not going to assist you in determining
where the escaped prisoner is now.

26
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:43,168
For that matter, it's our responsibility.

27
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,438
We will find a way to solve it.

28
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:48,188
Anyway, if you can predict the future,

29
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,008
I hope you can help us prevent
murders from happening.

30
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:53,838
My divination is not about
predicting the future.

31
00:02:54,688 --> 00:02:56,978
In essence, I am just observing
the trends of the future.

32
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,178
The paths you have walked in the past

33
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,708
and the countless possible paths
that extend into the future.

34
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,218
I haven't seen him show such
an expression at home.

35
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,128
Looks quite like the real deal.

36
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:13,488
He must have been tempered
on the underworld to some extent.

37
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:17,438
If fake Polka is plotting something
behind the scenes,

38
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,128
reporting to these two people
who look like police officers

39
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:22,098
could be a means of getting rid of him.

40
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,208
I don't need to divine your profession.

41
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,138
I can tell without divination.

42
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,578
It's hard not to know about that.

43
00:03:29,298 --> 00:03:30,848
If I observe more carefully,

44
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:32,768
I find countless hands

45
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,888
surrounding you.

46
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,418
To protect the peace of the people,

47
00:03:39,698 --> 00:03:41,058
you have offered advice and shelter
to young boys and girls.

48
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,798
You sometimes become a shield to protect
others from knife-wielding attackers.

49
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,308
-He knows that I belong to the Community Safety Division.
-Sometimes, you become a heroic steel cable

50
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,898
-Perhaps Takumi Kuruya has gathered
-that restrains sharp weapons in battle.

51
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:52,128
-intelligence and provided it to him.
-You guide people like yourself.

52
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,188
That headscarf must have

53
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:55,648
-some kind of communication device inside.
-For your own safety…

54
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:58,128
He must be Iwanome from
the Community Safety Division.

55
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,888
It's really annoying that troublemakers
keep coming one after another.

56
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:06,288
Probably because when you visited
your ancestors and their houses,

57
00:04:06,908 --> 00:04:09,568
you saw many flower cards of ladies.

58
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,168
He even investigated
my blind date history.

59
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:15,418
Your past has

60
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,838
left a huge scar,

61
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:22,638
even causing you to lose your wings.

62
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,598
As long as this scar remains
on your mind,

63
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:29,148
you can only continue to move
forward on the underwater path.

64
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:32,578
Your words have piqued my interest.

65
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:36,638
So, will you tell me

66
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,208
the method to get rid of this scar?

67
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,918
Do you want to get rid of this scar?

68
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:43,488
This is hard to say.

69
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:46,878
If there is the path
that can guide me towards

70
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:49,488
the place where the guy who
caused this scar resides,

71
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,418
then please do point it out for me.

72
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:53,568
Those shattered wings

73
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,478
will become the milestones
that guide you forward.

74
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:03,868
That pen scared me a bit.

75
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,788
Incredible.

76
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:13,278
This voice sounds exactly like the one

77
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:16,338
I heard last night
when someone was writing something.

78
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:18,418
I see.

79
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:19,898
They were chatting about comics and games,

80
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,508
while constantly practicing
this kind of magic.

81
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:31,538
Mr. Iwa?

82
00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:36,108
Why?

83
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:38,898
What do you really know,

84
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:42,188
Polka Shinoyama?

85
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:44,688
Iwanome.

86
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:48,318
Is this for me? This is rare.

87
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,828
The brand is one that I like.

88
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:53,968
I still can't smoke
this kind of cigarette.

89
00:05:56,368 --> 00:05:57,488
What is this sign?

90
00:05:58,018 --> 00:05:58,928
Do you remember it?

91
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:01,088
Hmm, I roughly remember it.

92
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,458
Don't forget it.

93
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:08,878
We must never let others see this sign.

94
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,748
It is not only the milestone
we are pursuing,

95
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:17,618
but also a one-way ticket to death.

96
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:19,978
Why did you draw this?

97
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,868
I'm just pointing the way for you.

98
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:26,368
You only need to follow your heart

99
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:28,448
and take actions.

100
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:34,878
Sorry, sorry.

101
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:37,098
I was a little scared.

102
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,598
Take it.

103
00:06:40,178 --> 00:06:41,298
This is the fee for divination.

104
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,668
I can't take that much money.

105
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:47,888
Just take it.

106
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:50,538
It includes compensation
for wrinkling your clothes.

107
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:53,488
We won't bother you anymore today.

108
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,008
Goodbye.

109
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,958
Goodbye, Polka Shinoyama.

110
00:07:00,018 --> 00:07:01,088
Corpse God.

111
00:07:02,828 --> 00:07:04,378
The person who has divined for you here

112
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:06,688
is not Polka Shinoyama

113
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,018
but the Corpse God.

114
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:10,718
Alright.

115
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:14,058
The title of a diviner is very important.

116
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:17,418
However, your title sounds
like a calamity,

117
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,878
which makes me feel a little overwhelmed.

118
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,218
What's calamity?

119
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,938
Do you know those two people just now?

120
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:31,578
They are police officers.

121
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:35,308
They seemed to come here
because of the fire accident.

122
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,528
The attitude of that police officer
was strange just now.

123
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:41,738
What exactly was written on that paper?

124
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:45,598
Maybe it's a secret
related to the fake Polka.

125
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,608
I need to find out.

126
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,458
Young lady.

127
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,578
I'm going to buy ingredients for dinner.

128
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,618
Thank you.

129
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:56,878
Then I'll leave it to you.

130
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,128
If you have time, please also pick up some
shark-related merchandise

131
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,778
on the way back,
even if I have had a few of them.

132
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,408
Yes.

133
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,688
CURRY SHOP NANCY
One bite is enough to taste the deliciousness

134
00:08:07,118 --> 00:08:08,208
of the round, large chunks of meat

135
00:08:09,298 --> 00:08:11,618
and the fresh, tender shrimp

136
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,028
before the spicy surge that will follow.

137
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:15,788
It's really delicious.

138
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,898
Mr. Iwa, why do you always have
such an expression when you eat here?

139
00:08:19,218 --> 00:08:20,268
That's so exaggerated.

140
00:08:29,438 --> 00:08:32,378
If you have anything else to say
to me, just go ahead.

141
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:33,648
You're making me feel awkward.

142
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:36,018
Can I ask you about that thing?

143
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:38,538
Although I don't really
want anyone to bring up that matter,

144
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,438
it's still better than eating in silence.

145
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,858
Then I will ask.

146
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,608
What exactly happened just now?

147
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,348
Oh, sorry.

148
00:08:46,748 --> 00:08:47,778
I lost my composure.

149
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:49,568
That doesn't seem like you.

150
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:52,368
Isn't threatening others
my responsibility?

151
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,128
If I am the whip,

152
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:56,588
then you are maltose mixed with poison.

153
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,258
Am I right?

154
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:00,858
That's what I said before.

155
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:03,198
I'm speechless to respond.

156
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:06,318
What exactly was written on that paper?

157
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,058
Sorry.

158
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,768
Let me think it over on the way.

159
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:14,848
I'll tell you when we get to
the next destination.

160
00:09:15,438 --> 00:09:17,058
Understood, then I'll just
wait a little longer.

161
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,768
I felt relieved when I saw you
return to your usual state.

162
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:24,498
Well, now I can't help but calm down.

163
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,698
My impulsivity caused
the whole mess before.

164
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,398
I have an idea.

165
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,248
I'll just follow them for a while.

166
00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:39,538
I bought the ingredients and shark-related
merchandise at the grocery stores.

167
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:41,138
I've really done a good job.

168
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:48,108
I heard Shinoyama's house burned down.
I was quite happy at first,

169
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:50,878
but I didn't expect this building
to be affected too.

170
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,598
Leader, isn't this vault fireproof?

171
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,228
There's something I must take out.

172
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,518
What if the police or firefighters see it…

173
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:02,478
Is it something bad?

174
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:04,058
Stop talking

175
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:05,198
and keep watch.

176
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:09,178
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

177
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:12,378
Blow the little trumpet.

178
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:19,378
The toy march goes tick-tock.

179
00:10:20,138 --> 00:10:26,578
THIS WORLD IS A BUGGY PROGRAM
A line of puppet soldiers,

180
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:33,728
little horses and dogs together,
tick-tock.

181
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:38,858
Summer bugs,

182
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,728
go wherever you want.

183
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,258
Of course, it goes wherever it wants.

184
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:48,958
Turn, turn.

185
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,168
It's not parchment,

186
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:56,878
nor pigskin.

187
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:00,398
Could it be human skin?

188
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:03,888
This is the bug you mentioned, right?

189
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,518
The Firestarter.

190
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,558
I've decided on the theme for
my comeback performance.

191
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,158
Let's make the world more lively together.

192
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:18,674
Oh, what a disaster it is.

193
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,464
By the way, why did that detective

194
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:23,372
suddenly grab your collar?

195
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:26,732
What did you ask the soul
attached to that guy?

196
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:29,282
That person wasn't possessed by anything.

197
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:31,812
Really?

198
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,362
Actually, not many people

199
00:11:33,712 --> 00:11:35,172
will be possessed.

200
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,812
At the time, I was providing advice

201
00:11:37,342 --> 00:11:39,362
for him based on what Takumi

202
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,812
had researched.

203
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,192
Huh?

204
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:45,632
It means that you wrote something casually
and it angered that guy?

205
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:47,452
No, I think it's because…

206
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,352
Hey, why did you keep it from me?

207
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,912
Oh, what could I possibly hide from you?

208
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:57,932
To be honest, I have given up.

209
00:11:58,372 --> 00:11:59,262
Right.

210
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:01,812
I cannot help but believe
in this kind of thing.

211
00:12:02,732 --> 00:12:05,252
That person cannot die easily.

212
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:07,232
What are you talking about?

213
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:09,022
At this point, don't play dumb anymore.

214
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:12,352
That person disappeared
from this city five years ago.

215
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,282
Only you can do such a thing.

216
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:19,572
And I know Polka Shinoyama
is related to you.

217
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:21,132
Who is that person?

218
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:25,212
He unexpectedly conveyed a message
to me through divination.

219
00:12:27,472 --> 00:12:29,152
What Polka Shinoyama wrote down

220
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,932
should be information that
only I and that person knew.

221
00:12:32,722 --> 00:12:35,172
If he mentioned it to
anyone other than me,

222
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,452
it would be you.

223
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:40,402
Very sorry.

224
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:43,012
I have no idea what you're talking about.

225
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,662
Who exactly is the person
you're referring to?

226
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:48,672
Don't play dumb anymore.

227
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:50,962
He said he hoped to handle it on his own,

228
00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:53,172
so I handed it over to him.

229
00:12:54,782 --> 00:12:57,762
So I don't know what
he wrote on the paper.

230
00:12:58,382 --> 00:12:59,852
The room was dark,
and I couldn't see clearly either.

231
00:13:00,402 --> 00:13:01,202
What?

232
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,912
Are you saying that the person who
wrote something to the detective is…

233
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:06,992
He is a prosecutor who is
quite unpopular with the police

234
00:13:07,502 --> 00:13:09,922
because he used to fool around with me,

235
00:13:10,642 --> 00:13:12,982
and he is also your important senior.

236
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,342
-Mr. Hosorogi.
-Mr. Hosorogi.

237
00:13:16,432 --> 00:13:17,972
So, Mr. Hosorogi.

238
00:13:17,992 --> 00:13:19,952
Do you know that detective?

239
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,768
SHINJUKU IS REALLY SMALL
OR SHOULD I SAY "THE WATER RUNS DEEP"

240
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,952
This is quite a memorable name.

241
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:31,312
Well, I may not have said
this name for a long time.

242
00:13:31,922 --> 00:13:33,052
Your looks happy,

243
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,772
but you are also angry.

244
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:37,262
That's natural.

245
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,612
After all, only I was being played around.

246
00:13:40,562 --> 00:13:43,072
As for the reason why I'm angry,

247
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,422
it's mainly related to what happened
with Polka Shinoyama.

248
00:13:46,112 --> 00:13:47,742
What happened to that child?

249
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:50,242
The purpose of
the Community Safety Division

250
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,622
is not to provide guidance to children,

251
00:13:53,392 --> 00:13:55,632
but to protect

252
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,892
their past, present, and future.

253
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,832
This is what Mr. Hosorogi told me

254
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:02,862
when I served as
the director of the region.

255
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:06,592
Oh, that's really strange.

256
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,252
Are you saying Mr. Hosorogi

257
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:11,122
involved Polka in something?

258
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:13,502
I'm not sure if you're doing it

259
00:14:13,952 --> 00:14:15,372
out of necessity or intentionally.

260
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,012
If it's the former,

261
00:14:17,252 --> 00:14:20,032
then I should confront you face-to-face.

262
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,482
There's no need to involve

263
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,652
the child in this mess.

264
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,402
At least,

265
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,122
I don't remember ever
involving him in anything.

266
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,152
I just lent the building to

267
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:33,682
Polka Shinoyama out of goodwill.

268
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:38,012
I was able to connect with a key
member of Shinoyama Group.

269
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:41,612
How could I let such a
tempting opportunity slip by?

270
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:42,962
I see.

271
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:47,102
If your good intentions stem
from self-interest, they're still valid.

272
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:49,072
In that case,

273
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:52,482
you should not incite them to get involved
in Mr. Hosorogi's affairs.

274
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,282
If they start investigating
this matter out of interest,

275
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:58,352
both Polka and the bespectacled
high school girl will be in danger.

276
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,322
This is an event that even Mr. Hosorogi

277
00:15:00,472 --> 00:15:02,852
had to hide his whereabouts for.

278
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:08,032
You speak as if you are certain
that he is still alive.

279
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:12,002
After all, I have received some
intelligence that only I can understand.

280
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,272
Forget it.

281
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:15,982
If you want to play dumb, go ahead.

282
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,172
But listen carefully to me,

283
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:21,092
this time I must cut off the
cancerous tumor in the police force

284
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:24,162
and create a place where
Mr. Hosorogi can reside.

285
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:28,622
Clarissa, what he said just now is…

286
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:30,092
You can ignore it.

287
00:15:30,592 --> 00:15:33,182
But Polka might be Mr. Hosorogi's…

288
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:34,532
It doesn't matter.

289
00:15:35,182 --> 00:15:37,372
That person is definitely
only thinking about money.

290
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:40,222
He wouldn't care about someone like me.

291
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:43,292
Hosorogi and Clarissa.

292
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:47,052
It seems necessary for me to investigate
the people in this bar.

293
00:15:48,142 --> 00:15:50,112
I must crush these poisonous insects

294
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:52,932
who are close to the Master.

295
00:15:54,302 --> 00:15:56,092
The prosecutor of the
Metropolitan Police Department!

296
00:15:56,572 --> 00:15:57,772
What is a prosecutor?

297
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:00,892
Prosecutor will supervise internal
misconduct of the police.

298
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:03,252
Speaking of which,

299
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:05,842
IMPERIAL GORGEOUS UNIT, DEPUTY CHIEF OF APPRAISAL AND RESTRAINT AGENCY, JUNGGLAD DILOMLEAGUE XIV
there are similar roles in my world too.

300
00:16:06,492 --> 00:16:08,082
So, Mr. Hosorogi,

301
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:10,482
are you saying that you're
the superior of those detectives?

302
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:11,616
ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT

303
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:12,642
BUT WE KNOW EACH OTHER

304
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:13,872
Really?

305
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:15,292
Incredible.

306
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,352
Did you do anything that
fit the role of a prosecutor?

307
00:16:18,624 --> 00:16:22,692
BACK THEN I WAS OFTEN CALLED A DELINQUENT
INSPECTOR AND A SCUMBAG WHO EXPOSED SCUM.

308
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:23,682
So cool.

309
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:25,052
What's so cool about?

310
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:28,062
So what did you write on
that piece of paper,

311
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:29,342
Mr. Hosorogi?

312
00:16:29,342 --> 00:16:32,752
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, YOU HAVE TO PAY
ME INFORMATION FEE.

313
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:34,592
Were you really a prosecutor before?

314
00:16:35,182 --> 00:16:37,012
THE FEE IS 1 MILLION YEN, NOT EVEN ONE LESS
Well, I can't afford that much money.

315
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:39,692
DON'T WORRY, THERE ARE PLENTY OF WAYS TO MAKE MONEY.
LEAVE IT TO ME.

316
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:40,912
Why are you being so tough?

317
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:43,132
It's just because you wrote
something on paper

318
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,042
that the police grabbed Polka's collar?

319
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,688
WELL, I REALLY DID SOMETHING WRONG.
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU SINCERELY. SORRY.

320
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:50,944
SORRY FOR INVOLVING YOU GUYS IN THIS
MATTER. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A HURDLE.

321
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:53,552
Ah, then there's nothing
we can do about it.

322
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:54,802
What does this mean?

323
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,122
As for the price of being used by me,

324
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:59,742
I will help him fulfill his unfulfilled
wish in this world.

325
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:02,412
This is the contract between
Mr. Hosorogi and me.

326
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:05,292
If his wish has been fulfilled,

327
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,052
won't he go to heaven?

328
00:17:07,264 --> 00:17:09,280
I AM NOT UNGRATEFUL PERSON

329
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,842
If those police officers
can handle things smoothly,

330
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,492
will you be able to fulfill a wish?

331
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,282
WELL… HOPEFULLY

332
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,172
Got it.

333
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:17,982
Unfinished wish…

334
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:21,442
Then I will have to face Lisa directly.

335
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:25,552
The world is both vast and small.

336
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,852
If two people truly wish to meet again
from the bottom of their hearts,

337
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,322
it can be easily achieved.

338
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:32,592
Don't you think so?

339
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:37,792
Prisoner ID number 243291343432497.

340
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,582
You just randomly assigned
me a prisoner number.

341
00:17:42,612 --> 00:17:44,942
You didn't come to see me just
to talk about this, did you?

342
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:46,972
Tena Sorimura.

343
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,022
No, it should be Phantom Solitaire.

344
00:17:50,372 --> 00:17:51,332
Then I will call you

345
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:53,532
Your Excellency the Grocer.

346
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:56,322
But speaking of which,
can you act more surprised?

347
00:17:56,722 --> 00:17:59,852
I hope this joke about the prisoner
ID number can make you laugh.

348
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:04,012
If you want me to smile, you have to
provide something that is worth it.

349
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,164
If you can satisfy me even more,
I might even refund the difference.

350
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,636
Forget it.

351
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,052
Someday, I will make you laugh.

352
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:14,468
Today, I just came to
make a deal with you.

353
00:18:15,044 --> 00:18:17,252
Thank you very much for
your preference for my store.

354
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:20,580
I want to buy intelligence.

355
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:23,316
For everything related to this sign
that you know,

356
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:24,500
I want to buy it all.

357
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,324
I certainly have the information you want.

358
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:30,244
So let's talk about the deal.

359
00:18:30,948 --> 00:18:33,940
For a starting offer, please provide
equivalent information.

360
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,572
The Grocer.

361
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:40,116
According to the information from
the Metropolitan Police Department,

362
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:43,572
it can be traced back to a businessman
who existed 100 years ago.

363
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,060
The man arrested by Iwanome

364
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,324
in modern times is a descendant

365
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:52,260
of that businessman recorded
in the data 100 years ago.

366
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,276
He was identified as the fifth-generation
inheritor of that businessman.

367
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,884
In the disciplined detention center,
he created a special space.

368
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,924
Allowing you to keep this space precisely

369
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,972
reflects the essence of the Grocer.

370
00:19:06,452 --> 00:19:08,436
This single-person cell

371
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:12,084
is exactly what he obtained through
his dealings with the nation,

372
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,980
and it is also proof of his power.

373
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:18,100
He relies neither on force nor
knowledge but on trade.

374
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,036
This is the simplest power.

375
00:19:20,596 --> 00:19:23,028
From individual lives to
national destinies,

376
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,076
there is nothing in this world
that cannot be traded.

377
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:29,876
Mass-produced goods, limited editions,
stolen items, lost property, sacred relics.

378
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:34,292
Except for one thing, his own heart.

379
00:19:35,748 --> 00:19:38,228
I'm not very good at violence,

380
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,204
but if it comes to a point
when I need to deal with issues,

381
00:19:41,604 --> 00:19:43,140
I will use playing cards as weapons.

382
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:44,580
Why have

383
00:19:45,396 --> 00:19:46,660
people believed that

384
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,412
playing cards could be used as weapons
from ancient times to the present?

385
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,232
I never studied,

386
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:55,748
so I don't know about
that kind of history.

387
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,012
The answer is only one.

388
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:58,692
Because it's cool.

389
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:01,412
I see.

390
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,604
You have wasted quite a bit of my time.

391
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,540
The price needs to be
raised a little more.

392
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,796
Wait!

393
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:10,516
Didn't you say "For a starting offer,
please provide equivalent information"?

394
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:12,852
So that's why I told you
my valuable information.

395
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,668
I'm not sure what your
standard for "valuable" is.

396
00:20:16,164 --> 00:20:17,732
At least for me,

397
00:20:17,912 --> 00:20:20,676
the stock price of Phantom Solitaire
has plummeted.

398
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:21,796
SOLITAIRE
You are being completely unreasonable.

399
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,572
This is what I want to say.

400
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,548
Well, then let me give you
another piece of valuable information.

401
00:20:27,908 --> 00:20:29,172
When counting money,

402
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:30,862
applying some oil to your hands

403
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,172
can reduce the chance of
injuring your fingers.

404
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:36,036
Isn't it enough to wear
rubber gloves or apply hand cream?

405
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:41,428
You, as a rare criminal, yet provide me
with such idiotic intelligence.

406
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:44,164
Okay, it's somewhat valuable.

407
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:45,540
How could you say something
like that to me?

408
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:47,524
As an exchange of learning,

409
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,572
I offer you these.

410
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:51,140
DELICIOUS STICKS
It should be enough.

411
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,292
30 yen.

412
00:20:52,722 --> 00:20:54,964
They taste pretty good, so I'll take them.

413
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:56,404
But don't try to fool me with food.

414
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,908
Quickly present the intelligence
that I'm dying to know.

415
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:03,476
There are many meanings behind
the symbols on playing cards.

416
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,612
As for French playing cards,

417
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:09,412
spades represent swords
and clubs represent cudgels.

418
00:21:09,764 --> 00:21:12,996
Hearts represent cups
and diamonds mean money.

419
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,060
Symbols of all kinds released
throughout the world,

420
00:21:17,508 --> 00:21:18,788
and their simplified results

421
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,940
almost always have some kind of meaning.

422
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,522
For example,

423
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:26,756
this diagonal line represents a sword.

424
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:30,388
There once existed an ancient knightly
order in Central and Eastern Europe

425
00:21:30,482 --> 00:21:32,580
that used a crest somewhat similar.

426
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:34,580
However, it is not the same
as the one you provided.

427
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:37,780
Okay, the free trial ends here.

428
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,604
If you want to get more information,

429
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,912
you need to provide something
of equal value.

430
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:44,180
Okay, I'm doing this
all for the performance.

431
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:45,860
You name your price.

432
00:21:46,292 --> 00:21:47,204
Have you thought about it?

433
00:21:48,356 --> 00:21:52,612
My price is based on the amount
of money customers have on hand.

434
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:54,964
But when I say "amount of money on hand,"

435
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:58,532
I don't mean the cash in the wallet.

436
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,260
Today is the day

437
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:13,060
mentioned in the
Phantom Solitaire preview.

438
00:22:13,508 --> 00:22:15,284
What kind of action will he take?

439
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:16,804
Oh? Today?

440
00:22:17,124 --> 00:22:19,188
What is he going to do?
I'm so looking forward to it.

441
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,196
He doesn't seem like the kind of person
who would plan a bomb terrorist attack.

442
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,700
Good morning.

443
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:26,052
What a great morning.

444
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:27,716
It's already noon.

445
00:22:28,068 --> 00:22:29,044
Don't worry.

446
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:32,724
You don't need to distinguish between
morning and noon when guarding your room.

447
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:34,868
What kind of twisted logic is this?

448
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:35,632
Morning.

449
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:36,724
Morning.

450
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,548
Hey, what's that?

451
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,316
Wow! Amazing!

452
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,836
There's something over Shinjuku there.

453
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:07,060
Countless airships appeared in the sky.

454
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,604
Why?

455
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:19,124
I have already been reincarnated
into another world, haven't I?

456
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,552
Polka, do you recognize that sign?

457
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,996
It's unmistakable.

458
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:27,140
That is

459
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:30,260
the emblem of the empire
that I once lived in.

460
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,156
The empire has long since been destroyed.

461
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:40,000
