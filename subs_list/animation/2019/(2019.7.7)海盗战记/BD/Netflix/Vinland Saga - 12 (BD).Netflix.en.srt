EPISODE 12: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY

2
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,210
Catch anything, old man?

3
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,260
It's nearly hibernation season for fish.

4
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,300
I don't mind not catching anything

5
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,060
since my main work is as a ferryman.

6
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,140
You're all Danish, aren't you?

7
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,650
You speak English well enough,

8
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,270
but you've got a slight accent.

9
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,400
It's similar to the accent of my country.

10
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,950
How much is the ferriage
to the opposite bank?

11
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,660
Two silver coins.

12
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,200
I also take strong drink.

13
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,500
Now then, to transport you all
will take several days.

14
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,170
No.

15
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,960
The only cargo is this letter.

16
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,180
That's too bad.
I was hoping there'd be passengers.

17
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,220
So whose the recipient on the other bank?

18
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,180
Deliver is now to one of the elders.

19
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,020
Tell them
it's from the son of Lydia, Askeladd.

20
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,240
Understood. I will do so promptly.

21
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,470
Askeladd!

22
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,850
Askeladd! Where are you?

23
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,770
Hey!

24
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,940
Ragnar, please be quiet.

25
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,900
Why have we stopped marching?

26
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,110
Thorkell will overtake us!

27
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,570
When Ear is working, we must keep quiet.

28
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,490
Ear?

29
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,120
Bjorn, stop that cone head from breathing.

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,040
Ear!

31
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,000
How's the situation?

32
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,880
They're closer than yesterday.

33
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,880
I hear footsteps and horses marching.

34
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Close too

35
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,010
500 of them.

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,050
They're right behind us.

37
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,010
About a day's distance away on foot.

38
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,600
Are you sure, Ear?

39
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,890
Yesterday you said
they were two days away.

40
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Are you doubting my hearing?

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
They're quick.

42
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,400
They're marching at a fast pace.

43
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,990
At this rate,
they'll reach us in a few days.

44
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,360
Quiet, everyone!

45
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,870
Horses. Two on the hill!

46
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,380
We're entirely within their grasp.

47
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,130
What do we do?

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,050
If we're to counter,
we must get into formation now.

49
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,850
No, impossible.

50
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,390
We wouldn't succeed.

51
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,100
But at this rate…

52
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,850
I've sent for reinforcements.

53
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,400
For now, we'll try to shake them off here.

54
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,980
-Huh?
-Reinforcements?

55
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Reinforcements?

56
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,000
We're right in enemy territory.

57
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,170
That's what Askeladd said, right?

58
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,300
You ever hear him lie
about something like this?

59
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,800
I guess not. That's true.

60
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,180
But where's the nearest fort?

61
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
Leicester.

62
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,640
Are you serious?

63
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,010
It'll take us two weeks!

64
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,730
Will reinforcements really arrive in time?

65
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,020
With more help,
won't we have to share the spoils?

66
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,900
Askeladd said we'd be splitting it
just between the 100 of us.

67
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,860
I am so exhausted!

68
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,400
I wanna sail on a ship.

69
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,030
Yeah.

70
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,950
If only we had a ship.

71
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,430
What?

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,690
Something you need?

73
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,110
Everyone is restless.

74
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,820
You must explain what we're doing.

75
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,240
Let them be restless.

76
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,450
A little agitation is good
if it spurs them to pick up the pace.

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
What?

78
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,670
If there's nothing else, go to sleep.

79
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:53,170
You've been acting strangely
these past few days.

80
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,930
What are you thinking?

81
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,680
You've been like this
since seeing the prince's face.

82
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,280
I've been living among scoundrels
for more than 40 years.

83
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,610
With just one glance

84
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,950
I can tell whether a man
is proud or meek, clever or foolish.

85
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,540
When I saw the prince's face,

86
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,420
I understood.

87
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,630
He doesn't have the face of a king.

88
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,510
Yeah, he looks more like a woman.

89
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,970
But you know, he's just a kid.

90
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,520
Well, that's true.

91
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
He's still young.

92
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,730
It starts now.

93
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,610
What does?

94
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,730
All right, wake up, you bastards!

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,650
Prepare to march!

96
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,240
Waste time and Thorkell will catch up!

97
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,780
What?

98
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,990
Is he serious?

99
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,450
It's still pitch black out.

100
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,460
Hey.

101
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,540
What?

102
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,880
Did you sleep?

103
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,590
No.

104
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Hey.

105
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,180
You're so loud. Shut up.

106
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,300
But if I don't talk,

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm going to fall asleep.

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,310
We're in trouble, Askeladd.

109
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,520
They're close.

110
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,400
Yeah, I know.

111
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,730
At this rate, they'll catch us.

112
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,320
I know that.

113
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,360
We're almost to the rendezvous point.

114
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,950
See? There.

115
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,920
They're our reinforcements?

116
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:39,970
Two men?

117
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,090
They're not evil fog demons, right?

118
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm grateful to you
for coming yourself, Commander.

119
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,030
It's been a long time, Askeladd.

120
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,990
So.

121
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,280
You say all those men got into a ship
and crossed the river?

122
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,790
Do you know whose ship it was?

123
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,540
No, I couldn't tell.

124
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,130
The fog was as thick as goat's milk.

125
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,210
It wasn't a Norse ship.

126
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,800
There was no dragon's head.

127
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Yeah, it was a stodgy-looking ship.

128
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm sure I saw eyes painted on it.

129
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,010
Wide eyes on the bow.

130
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,720
That doesn't seem like King Sweyn's ship.

131
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,850
Either way, we can no longer trace
the footsteps of Thorfinn and the rest.

132
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,360
We may have underestimated them.

133
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,110
Who knew they'd have an ally
on the other side of the River Severn?

134
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,620
Do you mean to say the people

135
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,490
across the river changed sides
from England to Denmark?

136
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,370
Fool. You don't know anything, do you?

137
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,880
It doesn't matter if they changed sides.
The land across the river isn't England.

138
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,210
That's Wales.

139
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:47,970
Wales.

140
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
A mountainous region
to the west of England.

141
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,350
Steep peaks, scarce resources,

142
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,400
and little flat land suitable for farming.

143
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,400
Compared with England,
it is a barren land.

144
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,570
Since the fall of the Roman Empire,

145
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,410
the country's regions never unified.

146
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,910
And several small kingdoms
held their ground for hundreds of years.

147
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,040
The call for help from Askeladd's army

148
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,750
was answered
by one of those small kingdoms.

149
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,170
EASTERN PART
OF THE KINGDOM OF MORGANNWG, WALES

150
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,930
I commend you, Askeladd.

151
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,060
Right about now, Thorkell's army must be
across the river grinding their teeth.

152
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,060
All we have to do now
is sail this route home to Gainsborough!

153
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,520
No, we'll be going by land from here.

154
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,070
What the hell are you talking about?
There are ships right here!

155
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,700
Consider it
from the perspective of a small nation.

156
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,040
Three warships in this country
hold great military value.

157
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,790
We must be grateful
they helped us escape Thorkell.

158
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,790
Then how about two ships?
We can squeeze in 100 if we try.

159
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,300
No. And I'll leave you behind
if you act like a spoiled child.

160
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,550
You're telling us to walk through Wales?

161
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,550
Inconceivable!

162
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,550
The people here hate us.

163
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I will not let you subject His Highness
to any further danger!

164
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:21,980
A falcon.

165
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,060
Flying so low.

166
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,320
Ragnar, capture it for me.

167
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,990
What? Your Highness, we're…

168
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,360
discussing something crucial.

169
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,330
It's better than heading north to England
with Thorkell on our tail.

170
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,790
At least I have allies in this country.

171
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,580
If you're still worried, then…

172
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,290
Thorfinn!

173
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,880
I will have this one escort the prince.

174
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,390
You're the boy from before.

175
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,760
Don't make decisions for me.

176
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,850
He's small but very skilled.

177
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,900
He's the same age as the prince,
so they'll get along.

178
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,810
Greet him, Thorfinn.

179
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,910
You idiot!

180
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,540
What are doing glaring at him like that?

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,660
I'll be compensated, right?

182
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,160
All right.

183
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,880
We'll duel upon reaching Gainsborough.

184
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,170
Askeladd, are you ready?

185
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,380
Yes, soon.

186
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,800
It never stops.

187
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,350
This is the commander
of the Kingdom of Morgannwg, Gratianus.

188
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,180
He will lead us through the route.

189
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,440
He seems harsh,
but is a strong-looking young man.

190
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,990
Commander, that's one of my men.

191
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,280
Prince Canute is over there.

192
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,700
His gaze lacks fortitude.

193
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Can this be the next generation
to lead England?

194
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,540
What? How dare you!

195
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:13,090
We only have one reason
for helping the Danish Prince escape.

196
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,840
Wales wishes to enter
a non-aggression pact.

197
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,390
Everything depends on you.

198
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,390
Prince, swear to us

199
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,680
that upon becoming the king of England,

200
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,600
you will not interfere
with the affairs of Wales.

201
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,450
I'll take care of this.

202
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,250
His Highness has stated the following:

203
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,830
"If you offer us three ships--"

204
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm asking the prince directly.

205
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,840
What?

206
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,260
In that case, I'll ask him again later.

207
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,270
In the meantime,
I will prepare the documents.

208
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,810
Quickly, assemble for departure.

209
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,110
How can he be so insolent?

210
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,900
He's taking advantage of us!

211
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,870
Does he think he can speak
to the prince as an equal?

212
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,580
The damned provincial fool!

213
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,630
Marching, marching, and more marching.

214
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,880
And now there's a mountain road.

215
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,800
A mountain road
is better than facing Thorkell.

216
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,970
Let's talk about something fun.

217
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,300
Like what?

218
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,850
The rewards we'll get from King Sweyn.

219
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,310
Saving the prince from Thorkell
has gotta be worth a lot.

220
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,690
-I'd like to get a whole farm.
-A fine sword would be nice.

221
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,110
No, I want gold.

222
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,110
There's nothing that beats gold.

223
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,820
That's the truth.

224
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,370
I heard that in his bedroom the king has
100 of the most beautiful concubines

225
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,830
from all over the world.

226
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,500
Now, that gets me excited! Tell me more!

227
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,880
Hey, Father!

228
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,720
You've been to the royal palace, right?

229
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,090
What's inside the king's chambers?

230
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,390
Well…

231
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,850
there was nothing of any value to me.

232
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,890
It can't be! Not even women?

233
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,940
Yes, there were quite a few female slaves.

234
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,280
He says that so casually.

235
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,110
You're not interested in women?

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,570
No.

237
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,240
Compared to that which I seek

238
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,990
money and women mean nothing.

239
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,210
Tell us please.

240
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,630
What is it you seek?

241
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,590
Love.

242
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,380
Huh? Love?

243
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:02,760
Yes.

244
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,220
What's that? I've never heard of it.

245
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,890
I have.

246
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,770
It's some magic word
that Christians always say.

247
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,310
It's not food?

248
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,520
How many pounds of silver is it worth?

249
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,400
It cannot be measured in silver.

250
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,280
Because love is what gives silver value.

251
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,030
Gold, silver, women, and everything else
have no value without love.

252
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,910
It gives value?

253
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,790
I don't think I get it.

254
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,080
Silver is worth silver.

255
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,830
Why make things complicated?

256
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,540
He's probably making it up.

257
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,840
Forget him.

258
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,090
Hey, monk.

259
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,970
Say more about it.

260
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,930
I'm interested.

261
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,810
We should be entering Brycheiniog soon.

262
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,810
Don't worry. I've spoken to them.

263
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,480
I appreciate your support.

264
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,610
We're not doing this for you.
It's in our best interest as well.

265
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,370
For a long time, the Welsh kingdoms
have suffered the invasions of England.

266
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,170
If you Danes can force them
into submission, it works in our favor.

267
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,420
The Prince will surely promise
to make that happen.

268
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,590
Is that your king, Askeladd?

269
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,390
The bloodline is good.

270
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,680
And as he is still young
there is much we can expect.

271
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,520
The more charmed you are by a man,
the less likely things will go your way.

272
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,900
But he may surprise us
and turn out to be the perfect vessel.

273
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,370
We are the proud descendants of Britannia.

274
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,250
We will not follow a Danish king.

275
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,410
Gratianus.

276
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,000
Do you still believe in that legend?

277
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,050
The one that claims Artorius
will return from Avalon in the far west

278
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,010
and revive the Britannia of old.

279
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,190
Askeladd!

280
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,190
You're certain?

281
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,360
That's what Ear said.

282
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,660
You've done well
to travel this far, Prince of Denmark!

283
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,370
An envoy from Brycheiniog.

284
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,410
Greetings to you!

285
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,920
Wait, Gratianus.

286
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,170
Did they notice?

287
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,880
How do you know?

288
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,300
I have a man with superb hearing.

289
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,180
But they're too late.

290
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,180
What's wrong, Thorfinn?

291
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,000
Stand up! Quickly!

292
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,750
Let's go.

293
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
