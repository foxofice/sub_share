1
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,059
Are you serious?

2
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,438
So, what will you do?

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,525
You are a gardener that maintains
our flower garden, are you not?

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,947
<i>What a shrewd man he is.</i>

5
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,704
<i>How ironic.</i>

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>No matter how hard I worked</i>

7
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,128
<i>with the pen or the sword,</i>
<i>I only became better than average.</i>

8
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,466
<i>But my appearance surpassed</i>
<i>that of anyone else.</i>

9
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,888
<i>The things you really want…</i>

10
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,473
<i>will rarely be yours.</i>

11
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>I struggled with this back in the day,</i>

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,147
<i>but now, I understand my role.</i>

13
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>A sweet gaze, a sweet voice…</i>

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,905
<i>I'll use whatever tools I have</i>
<i>to my advantage.</i>

15
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,575
<i>I know that</i>

16
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,703
<i>I'm just a child flailing</i>
<i>in the palms of the Emperor.</i>

17
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,166
As you will, My Lord.

18
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>I'll manage the rear palace.</i>
<i>I'll do anything.</i>

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>This is the only way</i>
<i>to choose my own path.</i>

ORIGINAL STORY BY: NATSU HYUUGA

00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:04,934
{\an8}VERDIGRIS HOUSE

22
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:05,894
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

23
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,103
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

24
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,355
{\an8}I don't need this much, Big Sis.

25
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,691
{\an8}Sure, sure. Take this, and that.

26
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:14,152
{\an8}Oh, take this too.

27
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,237
I won't be using lipstick.

28
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,116
Don't be ridiculous!
You should make yourself look presentable.

29
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,287
Only courtesans dress up
to go to work, you know…

30
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,542
I want to mix my medicine herbs… Ouch!

31
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:34,422
Hey, you got a good job in the court.

32
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,051
Don't you want to become
a person worthy of that position?

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,762
You have to be grateful for
what you're given in life.

34
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,057
Otherwise, even the best customers
will run away!

35
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,852
<i>Big Sis Meimei's words are persuasive.</i>

36
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,772
<i>She's old enough to</i>
<i>consider retiring as a courtesan,</i>

37
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,941
<i>but she remains popular because</i>

38
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>she has the intellect to</i>

39
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,946
<i>entertain her guests with song,</i>
<i>chess, and go.</i>

40
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,322
Maomao.

41
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,783
You packed heavy!

42
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,994
Big Sis Pairin, Big Sis Joka.

43
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,836
I'm glad you got a nice job.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,838
Go earn a lot, you hear?

45
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,757
Okay.

46
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,844
{\an8}It'd be helpful if you could bring
some high-paying guests.

47
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,889
{\an8}Find a rich, good husband, okay?

48
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,684
{\an8}Someone with a lot of vigor, okay?

49
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>My new workplace, or rather,</i>

50
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>the workplace I'm returning to</i>
<i>is the rear palace inside the court.</i>

51
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,867
<i>It's an all-women's world made to</i>
<i>bear the Emperor's children.</i>

52
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,328
{\an8}<i>I was only supposed to be a lowly maid,</i>

53
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,374
{\an8}<i>but I got noticed for solving the</i>
<i>serial deaths of the Emperor's children.</i>

54
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,960
<i>I got promoted to become</i>
<i>Lady Gyokuyou's attendant,</i>

55
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>then got roped into all kinds of</i>
<i>tricky business as a food taster.</i>

56
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,093
{\an8}<i>Many things happened</i>
<i>and I was dismissed from my position.</i>

57
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,595
{\an8}<i>I didn't think I'd be</i>
<i>serving the court again.</i>

58
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,643
<i>I got lured by the plant worms,</i>

59
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,187
<i>but it might've been</i>
<i>a thoughtless decision.</i>

60
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,941
<i>Of course, I'm extremely fortunate</i>
<i>compared to others.</i>

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:18,901
<i>I'm a bit worried about</i>

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,821
<i>leaving behind Old Man</i>
<i>to do live-in work again,</i>

63
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>but the rules will be less strict</i>
<i>than they used to be,</i>

64
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,576
<i>so I won't be considered "missing"</i>
<i>like before.</i>

65
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>Old Man said, "Do as you like," but…</i>

66
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,879
<i>What did he mean by that?</i>

67
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,049
I'm home.

68
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,013
Wow, you got a lot of gifts.

69
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,057
What should I do?

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,478
I definitely need my bowls and mortars,
and I need my notebook.

71
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,647
I can't bring even less underwear…

72
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,024
Maomao.

73
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,319
You probably shouldn't bring those things.

74
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,822
If you bring those things
even though you're not a physician,

75
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,659
they'll think you're plotting
a murder by poison.

76
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,830
Don't look like that.

77
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,707
You decided this yourself.

78
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,376
It's too late for take-backs now.

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,586
Really?

80
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,965
If you get permission in small batches,
there are some things you can bring.

81
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,967
Get ready and go to bed.

82
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,220
Tomorrow's your first day.

83
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,596
Okay…

84
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,196
What is this? You haven't done this
in a long time.

85
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,533
I thought you weren't a child anymore.

86
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,451
Well, it's cold.

87
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,039
I'll miss you, you know.

88
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,709
It'll be okay. This time, I can come home
whenever I want.

89
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,551
That's true. Come back anytime, okay?

90
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,554
<i>I don't have a mother.</i>

91
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,517
<i>But I have a kind father,</i>
<i>a nosy grandmother,</i>

92
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,853
<i>and many lively older sisters.</i>

93
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,691
<i>I can come home anytime I want.</i>

94
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,949
I'm sorry for the wait, Sir Jinshi.

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,088
Please take care of our girl.

96
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,675
We made sure she's all moisturized
and supple.

97
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,178
Don't forget, Maomao.

98
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,055
I know. High-paying customers, right?

99
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,224
All right, off you go!

100
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,478
What a stressful morning.

101
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,855
All right, let's go.

102
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,983
Sure.

103
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:04,901
Be careful.

104
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,403
I'm off.

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,739
She's beautiful!

106
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,366
I've never seen her
at the Verdigris House.

107
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,498
It's your fault, Sir Jinshi.

108
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,877
-They're all looking at us.
-That's because you're…

109
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,719
-What is it?
-Nothing.

110
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,990
Good work, all. Can we go now?

111
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,283
Yes, sir!

112
00:08:56,619 --> 00:09:00,289
Apothecary. Put your regular
freckled face on while you're here.

113
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,290
Huh?

114
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,918
All right, sir.

115
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,181
Hey, did you hear? A rear palace manager

116
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,976
bought out a courtesan
from the Verdigris House!

117
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,435
The Verdigris House?

118
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,896
That's where the Three Princesses are,
right?

119
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,856
The Verdigris House…?

120
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,780
<i>What is he doing?</i>

121
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,159
Where are we?

122
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,997
-This is my house.
-Why…?

123
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,125
This is your new workplace.

124
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,419
Sir Gaoshun.

125
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:50,131
I had assumed that I would be
returning to the rear palace…

126
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,300
You've already quit once.

127
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,052
It would be hard for you to return.

128
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,513
You will be working
at the outer court this time.

129
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
The outer court…

130
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,391
Yes.

131
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,810
The rear palace, where you were,
is the inner court.

132
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:05,021
The outer court is just outside of that.

133
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,525
It's home to many government offices.
I'll show you around later.

134
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,779
Welcome home. You must be freezing.

135
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,331
I'm the attendant, Suiren.

136
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,041
You must be Xiaomao.

137
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,001
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>Xiaomao?</i>

139
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:39,138
There are separate buildings
for the office and living quarters.

140
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,642
Beyond this point is Young Master's room…

141
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,352
<i>Young Master?</i>

142
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,730
You're probably fine.

143
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,985
<i>This is about the same size room</i>
<i>that I was using in the Jade Pavilion.</i>

144
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,197
<i>Now if this had a stove and a well nearby…</i>

145
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,573
Seems like

146
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,826
this room is too fancy
for a live-in maidservant.

147
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,371
-Xiaomao?
-Yes, ma'am!

148
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,249
I don't intend on you
being a servant here.

149
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,376
What?

150
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,504
I said you'd be working
at the outer court, no?

151
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,847
You'll be taking the court lady exam.

152
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:25,351
The court lady exam?

153
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,535
Clothes made out of cotton?

154
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,412
What special treatment I'm getting.

155
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,882
Good morning, Ms. Suiren.

156
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,135
Good morning, Xiaomao.

157
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,928
You're up early. Good on you.

158
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,263
I'm here to help.

159
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,015
No, I'm almost done here.

160
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,351
Can you just help carry these?

161
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,936
Yes, ma'am.

162
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,189
-What about the other attendants?
-We have none.

163
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,901
The office is fine,
but we can't have people

164
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,279
for his private rooms,

165
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,782
let alone his meals.

166
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,286
So you do everything on your own?

167
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:29,039
We've had new girls in the past,

168
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,792
but there's been incidents,
and we have to let them go.

169
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>Was he drugged with an aphrodisiac?</i>
<i>Or theft?</i>

170
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,132
{\an8}No one would enjoy

171
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,844
{\an8}finding underwear they've never seen
in their wardrobe.

172
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,095
{\an8}What?

173
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,183
{\an8}And instead of using thread,
it was woven with hair!

174
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,643
He has it rough, doesn't he?

175
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,604
He sure does.

176
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,857
Wake up, Young Master.

177
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,067
It's time for breakfast.

178
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,495
<i>He's being seductive for no reason…</i>

179
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>Now I get why only Sir Gaoshun</i>
<i>and Ms. Suiren can enter this room.</i>

180
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,794
<i>A woman will get hot and steamy</i>
<i>from his sex appeal,</i>

181
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,797
<i>and a man might try and do something.</i>

182
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,718
<i>How unfortunate that he attracts</i>
<i>all these sinful thoughts.</i>

183
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,929
<i>He's like an insect in heat.</i>

184
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,767
<i>If I collect this eunuch's smell</i>
<i>and make a love potion, it might sell!</i>

185
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,980
If you're fine with it,
I'll make them prepare a new room for you.

186
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,775
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

187
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,070
<i>I'm confused, but maybe it's a chance</i>
<i>to get a stove and a well?</i>

188
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,993
<i>If you want to say something, just say it!</i>

189
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,247
<i>I can probably find access to a stove…</i>

190
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,752
Then, perhaps a stable with a well nearby.

191
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,966
-A stable?
-Yes, sir.

192
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,678
No. I won't get you that.

193
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,602
All right. Let's start the tour.

194
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,604
Yes, thank you.

195
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,400
<i>Sir Jinshi had to stay home.</i>

196
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,904
<i>He's always wasting time at the</i>
<i>rear palace, so I thought he had no work,</i>

197
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,198
<i>but apparently, he's a very busy man.</i>

198
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,661
There are many soldiers on
the eastern side beyond this point.

199
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,372
So avoid this area if you can.

200
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,416
I understand.

201
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,919
<i>The palace I was shown around</i>
<i>was very large,</i>

202
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,838
<i>with so many buildings</i>
<i>and departments that</i>

203
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,923
<i>I couldn't count them</i>
<i>on my fingers and toes.</i>

204
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,843
<i>Could I really memorize them all?</i>

205
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,848
<i>I have terrible memory when it</i>
<i>concerns things I have no interest in.</i>

206
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,270
This is the Director of Waters.

207
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:00,566
This office deals with all irrigation
businesses like rivers and embankments.

208
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,483
I see…

209
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>The rear palace had more ingredients</i>
<i>that I could make medicine with.</i>

210
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,994
<i>My guess is that Old Man transported them</i>
<i>when he worked there.</i>

211
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,787
Xiaomao.

212
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,957
If you become a court lady,
this will be your workplace.

213
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:17,875
Yes, sir…

214
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,669
<i>A court lady, huh?</i>

215
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,931
Hello Xiaomao. Perfect timing.

216
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,808
Can you carry the charcoal to the office?

217
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,060
Yes, ma'am.

218
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,023
Excuse me.

219
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,033
<i>So this is Sir Jinshi's office…</i>

220
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,286
<i>It's not flashy, but everything is</i>
<i>high quality.</i>

221
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,539
<i>Just how high-class is</i>
<i>that "Young Master"?</i>

222
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,339
<i>Observing the newcomer, huh?</i>

223
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,424
<i>Bad vibes.</i>

224
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,931
<i>A court lady for the outer court</i>
<i>is basically a clerk.</i>

225
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,935
<i>They have certifications,</i>
<i>a good family, and a good education.</i>

226
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,022
<i>They're not like the palace women of</i>
<i>the rear palace with diverse backgrounds.</i>

227
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,441
<i>With such position comes pride.</i>

228
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,155
<i>That's why</i>

229
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>they don't need to clean.</i>
<i>It's not their job, after all.</i>

230
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,623
Just who do you think you are?

231
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,418
<i>They must be well-fed to grow this large.</i>

232
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:48,257
Hey, I'm talking to you! Why does someone
like you work directly for Sir Jinshi?

233
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:56,056
<i>I guess staying quiet would</i>
<i>upset them even more.</i>

234
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:00,728
Does this mean you are jealous
of my position?

235
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,939
Cut it out, will you?

236
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,608
<i>I worded it wrong.</i>

237
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,777
<i>Can't be helped.</i>

238
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,614
You think I'm getting special treatment?

239
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,577
Of course not, right?

240
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,456
Why would a heavenly maiden like him
pay any attention

241
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,915
to a plain girl like me?

242
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,421
You think that the man you respect
so much has such bad taste?

243
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,258
In a place with plenty of abalone
and boar meat,

244
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,429
he would eat a scrawny piece of chicken?

245
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,767
{\an8}That would mean he's got
a "unique preference" for girls.

246
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,977
That's not for me to understand.

247
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,105
So that's his taste, huh?

248
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,648
I see, a "unique preference…"

249
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,734
Of course not!

250
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:49,651
Exactly!

251
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,613
Then, why were you hired?

252
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:58,994
This is the reason.

253
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,337
{\an8}<i>I experimented with burn medicine</i>
<i>the other day,</i>

254
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,464
{\an8}<i>so my arm is in a pretty bad state.</i>

255
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,757
{\an8}It stings!

256
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,635
The beautiful heavenly maiden

257
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,179
also has the heart of one.

258
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:21,225
He even provides someone like me
with a way to feed myself.

259
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,978
Let's go.

260
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,155
Finally.

261
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,949
A "unique preference…"

262
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,621
Are you always getting caught up
in fights like that?

263
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,040
And what did you show on your left arm…

264
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,751
All right, then.
I'll be off to clean the next place.

265
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,671
And how's your studying going?

266
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,381
Scatter, scatter…

267
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,465
Hey!

268
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,716
Scatter, scatter…

269
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,446
Xiaomao…

270
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,199
Quiet, all right?

271
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,085
<i>And finally, the day of the exams arrived…</i>

272
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,173
Why did you fail?

273
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>Why did he think I'd pass?</i>

274
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,097
<i>Maomao became Jinshi's</i>
<i>personal room maidservant.</i>

275
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,434
What shall we do?

276
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,311
What shall we do, indeed?

277
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:25,057
The area beyond this point is forbidden
for people like you.

278
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,477
<i>Can't she tell me before punching me?</i>

279
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,982
<i>The scent of sandalwood</i>
<i>and a particular bitter aroma…</i>

280
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,662
The Board of Military, huh?

281
