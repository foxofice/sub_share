1
00:00:00,878 --> 00:00:03,130
8TH FLOOR

2
00:00:06,008 --> 00:00:06,842
Eh?

3
00:00:07,968 --> 00:00:13,140
Arai just went downstairs, right?

4
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,607
Kobeni, make a double "peace" sign
and stay where you are.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,157
Oh my…

6
00:00:35,704 --> 00:00:38,290
Aki, what's going on?

7
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,918
It might be a Devil.

8
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:44,171
Kobeni, stay there.

9
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:59,520
Another room on
the other side of the window?

10
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,791
Hey, we can't get out through the windows.

11
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,543
They all lead to the room directly across.

12
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:25,212
Guessed so.

13
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:27,589
We're stuck on the 8th floor.

14
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:30,050
There's no way out.

15
00:02:57,638 --> 00:03:00,933
CHAINSAW MAN

16
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,111
Let's go through the situation.

17
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:14,363
It's most likely a Devil's trick.

18
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:18,325
We go back to the 8th floor
whether we go up or downstairs.

19
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,120
<i>The elevator is somehow out of order.</i>

20
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:23,705
<i>The rooms and windows don't lead outside.</i>

21
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:27,668
<i>We also go back to the 8th floor
through the ceiling.</i>

22
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,048
Is it because of the Devil Power killed?

23
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,677
It might've sealed us here before it died.

24
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,594
That Devil--

25
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:39,888
-You told me to kill the Devil!
-I did not!

26
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:44,143
It's not possible.
A Devil's power would die with it.

27
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,895
Aki, the pieces have no reaction.

28
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,397
Speaking of that,

29
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,983
it just used that Devil as bait earlier.

30
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,737
And now it's keeping a low profile.

31
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,616
I've never seen such a wily Devil.

32
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,870
But if we don't get back to
headquarters in time,

33
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:06,039
other Devil Hunters will come here
to find us, right?

34
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:12,212
Let's hope they won't step into
this trap as we did.

35
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,384
Every one of us will die here.

36
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,387
We'll starve to death…

37
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,890
K-Kobeni, be brave.

38
00:04:22,973 --> 00:04:26,143
You're doing this job for your brother
to go to university, aren't you?

39
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:28,770
Half the reason is I'm forced to do this.

40
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:33,275
My parents want to send
only my smart brother to university.

41
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,277
And I'm told to make money.

42
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:39,990
It's either the sex industry
or the Devil Hunter.

43
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,955
I want to go to university too.

44
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,415
But…

45
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,460
I'll die here.

46
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:57,799
Your face…

47
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,428
You bitch!

48
00:05:02,012 --> 00:05:03,013
Stop laughing.

49
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,976
Kobeni, fear is a Devil's favorite dish.

50
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:11,688
They want you to be scared.

51
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:14,775
But I am scared.

52
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:17,945
Aki, you're acting strange too.

53
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,574
The clock in the room…

54
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:25,410
stays at 8:18.

55
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:29,915
<i>All the clocks on this floor
are staying at 8:18.</i>

56
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:34,086
It might be a Devil

57
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,798
who just froze the time on the 8th floor.

58
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:41,385
So, no one will probably come for us.

59
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:47,099
Great. Then I can sleep as long as I want.

60
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,477
Are you an idiot?

61
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:54,898
We could get stuck here forever.

62
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:58,485
Maybe, maybe not.

63
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:00,237
Wake me up when you figure it out.

64
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,991
It'd be such a waste to
not lie on these cozy beds.

65
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,244
I'll gladly sleep and
thank the Devil for this.

66
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,630
He really meant it…

67
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,595
Denji…

68
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,763
Time to get up.

69
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:36,606
You found a way out?

70
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,775
Unfortunately, not yet.

71
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,986
While you were sleeping,

72
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,739
we found out that the water supply
and electricity are still working.

73
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:48,368
There's some food left
by the guests who ran away.

74
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:52,372
Frankly, everyone is almost
at their limits.

75
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,293
<i>Aki keeps looking for the Devil.</i>

76
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,546
<i>He refused to take a rest.</i>

77
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:03,759
<i>Arai was supposed to go with Aki,</i>

78
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,679
<i>but he locked himself in a room
because he's too afraid of the situation.</i>

79
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:09,848
<i>Kobeni went totally mad.</i>

80
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,684
<i>She even wanted to drink from the toilet,
so I knocked her out.</i>

81
00:07:13,268 --> 00:07:15,312
As for the Fiend…

82
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:17,564
What about Power?

83
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:20,817
I have nothing to do except
think about the Nobel Prize.

84
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,694
As long as my invention
wins the Nobel Prize,

85
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:25,155
humans will treat me like a god.

86
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:30,369
Then I'll use the prestige
to become the Prime Minister.

87
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:33,580
I want to see humans struggling…

88
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:37,334
The first thing I'll do is adjust
the consumption tax to 100%.

89
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,587
-She's always like that.
-I see.

90
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,381
Good.

91
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:45,967
Let's keep a watch
on Kobeni and Arai together.

92
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,720
I can't even go to the bathroom
if I watch them alone.

93
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,239
Last cigarette.

94
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,741
It's so boring that you're so calm.

95
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:14,996
Aki is looking for the Devil.
I can take a break.

96
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,374
With the power of nicotine.

97
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,128
It's a good thing to
have something to rely on.

98
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:24,464
It's my wish to live
by relying on something else.

99
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:27,217
You smoke the same brand as Aki.

100
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:33,598
Because the person
who taught him to smoke…

101
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,350
was me.

102
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,274
You don't smoke, Aki?

103
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:44,526
It's bad for the bones. No.

104
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:47,279
You should learn it to get around people.

105
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:49,531
I don't plan to make friends.

106
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:56,204
Let me guess why you joined
the Public Sector.

107
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,290
You probably want to kill
the Gun Devil, right?

108
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,420
It's always the case with those
who came here with a poker face.

109
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,924
Because only we can keep Gun's pieces.

110
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,179
Devil Hunters are meant to die young,
so what's the big deal about a cigarette?

111
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,931
I won't die so easily.

112
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:16,808
Better keep your word.

113
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:20,061
It always brings so much trouble
when a teammate dies.

114
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:29,070
Why did she…

115
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:32,574
She's the girlfriend of a former teammate.

116
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,912
It happens very often to get ugly
with a late teammate's family.

117
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:39,831
They can't take revenge on the Devil
for their partner,

118
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:41,082
so they take it all out on me.

119
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:46,630
Yeah, I see it as part of the job
being a Devil Hunter.

120
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,307
What did you do?

121
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,397
I stuck some gum on the clothes
of the person who hit you.

122
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:07,901
What?

123
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,153
You should fight back if people hurt you.

124
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,822
You didn't do anything wrong.

125
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,908
I did that to her
because I was pissed about this.

126
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:16,409
She deserves it.

127
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,538
She'll never realize that
there's gum on her clothes.

128
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,255
CHUKA TENTEN

129
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:30,757
By the way, Master used to say

130
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,426
the Devil Hunter that
those Devils fear the most

131
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,096
is neither the strong one
nor the brave one,

132
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,849
but the one who's a nutcase.

133
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,018
So I think you can live a long life.

134
00:10:44,396 --> 00:10:45,730
Are you making fun of me?

135
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:48,191
Give me the almond tofu
if you don't want it.

136
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,612
This one's for you.

137
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,324
Cigarettes are bad for the bones.
I don't want it.

138
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:57,534
What?

139
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,412
I have a feeling that
we'll be teammates for a long time.

140
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:01,913
I really hope you can smoke.

141
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,383
Just this one then.

142
00:11:13,466 --> 00:11:16,219
I'll smoke just this once in my life.

143
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:21,391
Himeno, do you have cigarettes?

144
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,394
Sadly, this is the last one.

145
00:11:24,978 --> 00:11:26,605
Give it to me then.

146
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:30,442
Fine.

147
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:35,280
It's a kiss! No fair!
It's an indirect kiss!

148
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:36,448
Shut up.

149
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,870
Bad news.

150
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,914
The Devil we just killed.

151
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,042
I killed it!

152
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,543
That thing…

153
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:50,295
is getting bigger and bigger.

154
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:04,267
But I did kill it…

155
00:12:04,851 --> 00:12:06,519
A hotel we can't get out of.

156
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,271
A form I've never seen.

157
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,523
What kind of Devil is this?

158
00:12:11,232 --> 00:12:12,651
Humans.

159
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:14,611
You humans.

160
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,488
Stupid humans.

161
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,907
I want to have a contract with you.

162
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,450
It's talking.

163
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,534
What contract?

164
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:25,538
Let me eat that human named Denji.

165
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:28,792
Alive or dead… Just let me eat him…

166
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,421
Then I'll let everyone else
leave here without a scratch.

167
00:12:33,505 --> 00:12:35,173
I'll let you go back safe…

168
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,758
Sign the contract…

169
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,927
Sign the contract…

170
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:50,522
Denji…

171
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,773
Let it eat you.

172
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:20,510
Shut up.

173
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:23,763
Aki, how about calling
the fox to eat this thing?

174
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,348
Kon.

175
00:13:27,726 --> 00:13:29,394
I guessed so.

176
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:32,313
This place is completely isolated
from the outside world.

177
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,816
The fox's body is in Kyoto after all.

178
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,902
Let's use my ghost then.

179
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,241
It hurts!

180
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,457
It hurts…

181
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,083
It hurts!

182
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:53,251
It's getting bigger!

183
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:56,087
You're wasting your energy.

184
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:59,340
This is not my real body.

185
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:02,093
My heart is not here.

186
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:04,095
This is just my stomach.

187
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,349
You can't find me on the 8th floor.

188
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:12,353
Sign the contract
if you want to go home alive.

189
00:14:13,897 --> 00:14:17,066
It probably won't let you go
even if you let it eat me.

190
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,860
Wrong.

191
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,613
The Devil said it's a "contract."

192
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:26,367
The power of that word is immense
when a Devil says it.

193
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,870
As long as one party is
abiding by the contract,

194
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,456
the other has to do the same.

195
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,501
Whoever breaches the contract will die.

196
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:37,587
We really can get out if we kill you.

197
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,216
Ms. Himeno, we should kill him.

198
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:46,137
We should kill him and go outside
for any further discussion.

199
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:48,890
We'll all starve to death
if we don't do anything.

200
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:53,520
The law allows Devil Hunters
to sign a contract with the Devils.

201
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:56,147
We should accept the offer!

202
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:58,733
The Devil wants Denji dead.

203
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:02,153
It means Denji's death
is only beneficial for it.

204
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:04,489
So I refuse to sign.

205
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,032
I refuse too then.

206
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:07,784
What?

207
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,452
I agree to kill him.

208
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,580
Even if I have an invention
that can win the Nobel Prize,

209
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:15,375
there's no way to publish it
if I can't get out.

210
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,001
So, die for my Nobel Prize.

211
00:15:17,085 --> 00:15:19,921
A Fiend can't sign
a contract with a Devil.

212
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,006
So even if you killed Denji,

213
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,008
the Devil wouldn't be
obligated to let you out.

214
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:26,594
In short, we can't kill Denji.

215
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:28,513
We are Devil Hunters.

216
00:15:29,222 --> 00:15:31,266
We kill only Devils.

217
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:35,645
It's so boring. Let's play Sumo!

218
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,772
No! You always want to kill me!

219
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:46,156
I'm so hungry.

220
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:50,285
Aki, tell me the truth.
Did you think of a way to get out?

221
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:52,704
If the Devil is telling the truth,

222
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:54,789
then we aren't able to kill it.

223
00:15:54,873 --> 00:15:57,125
But I don't want to kill Denji.

224
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,295
We'll starve to death
if we don't do something.

225
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:06,134
I'll use my sword if I have to.

226
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:07,302
No way.

227
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:11,431
If he can't take care of it with a sword,

228
00:16:11,514 --> 00:16:12,765
why not use it?

229
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,936
He can't use the sword even if he has to.

230
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,230
I feel bad for saying this but…

231
00:16:19,898 --> 00:16:21,816
you'll have to die if it gets that bad.

232
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:25,820
It's gone.

233
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:28,823
The food on the bed…

234
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:30,575
It's all gone.

235
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:31,993
Why?

236
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:40,376
Did you eat all the food?

237
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,837
No. Denji did.

238
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,923
How can you say that
while you're still munching?

239
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:46,341
I see.

240
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:47,425
I…

241
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:49,344
I know now.

242
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:53,681
It's all because of this Fiend's power.
That's why we can't get out.

243
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:55,725
It must be the case!

244
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:56,726
You are wrong.

245
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,229
Kobeni, calm down. She's the Blood Fiend.

246
00:16:59,312 --> 00:17:00,980
Why are you on her side?

247
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,983
We are Devil Hunters.

248
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:09,113
Are you with the Devil? Are you a spy?

249
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:10,365
He's a spy.

250
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,784
I'm not with the Devil.

251
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,371
You must be a spy!

252
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:22,252
Scream?

253
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:23,711
Himeno! Run!

254
00:17:32,804 --> 00:17:34,347
Kill Denji.

255
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,723
Give me his heart.

256
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:37,684
Give it to me.

257
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,853
I expand for fear.

258
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,939
I exist for fear.

259
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,858
Be fearful.

260
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,986
Fear death.

261
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,738
Fear everything.

262
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:54,284
Only I can kill Chainsaw.

263
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,035
I am…

264
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,372
Eternity Devil.

265
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,296
It's tilting!

266
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,773
Give me Denji's heart.

267
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:26,774
Somebody!

268
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:29,277
Kill Denji now!

269
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,862
Please kill him!

270
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,488
It's an emergency!

271
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,490
Let the Devil eat him!

272
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:38,411
I'm going to use the sword.

273
00:18:38,494 --> 00:18:40,663
Okay? Himeno…

274
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:43,624
Himeno…

275
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,668
Hey you!

276
00:18:45,752 --> 00:18:47,295
What are you doing?

277
00:18:48,046 --> 00:18:51,174
We can definitely get out
if he uses that sword.

278
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,343
But with the contract,

279
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,428
Aki will die much sooner if he uses it.

280
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:59,140
He still has a lot to do.

281
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:00,808
So, I'm sorry.

282
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,060
Denji.

283
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:04,812
I'm sorry!

284
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:06,814
Don't touch me.

285
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,316
Let go of me!

286
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,572
Die!

287
00:19:41,224 --> 00:19:45,269
I don't really care if he gets killed.

288
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,188
That's how annoying he is.

289
00:19:47,814 --> 00:19:50,066
But he wants to kill the Gun Devil.

290
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,737
I can never kill the Gun Devil
just by myself.

291
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:56,906
To kill it,

292
00:19:57,907 --> 00:20:02,995
I need as many Devil Hunters
who will fight as possible.

293
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,165
Even if it means I have less time to live,

294
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,169
I still won't let you kill Denji.

295
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,171
Power.

296
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:14,173
You are the Blood Fiend.

297
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,259
Can you stop the bleeding?

298
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,680
I only control my own blood.

299
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:22,682
It's difficult to control others' blood,

300
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:28,521
but no one will cook for me
if the samurai head is dead.

301
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:31,190
Well, guess I'll help
you stop the bleeding.

302
00:20:38,114 --> 00:20:39,323
What do we do?

303
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:40,908
What do we do?

304
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,954
Aki, what should we do?

305
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,790
It's… not my fault!

306
00:20:48,374 --> 00:20:49,208
It's you!

307
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:51,294
It's all your fault!

308
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,087
If you had let the Devil eat you,

309
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,089
none of this would've happened.

310
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:57,967
Fine.

311
00:20:58,551 --> 00:20:59,969
Let it eat me then.

312
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,722
Thank goodness.

313
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:06,517
But I'll still fight back.

314
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:11,105
If I have a chance to kill that Devil,

315
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:14,484
don't forget that French kiss
you promised me.

316
00:21:15,693 --> 00:21:17,862
Do you have a chance to win?

317
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:19,822
It'll hurt like hell,

318
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:21,866
but I'll turn into a chainsaw.

319
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,160
Ch-Chainsaw…

320
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,161
For some reason,

321
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:29,165
it seems that the Devil is
afraid of my chainsaw.

322
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:31,959
That's why it wouldn't do it itself,

323
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,212
but it asked you to kill me.

324
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:40,301
And it kept screaming in pain
while being attacked.

325
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,803
So,

326
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,389
why not give it hell

327
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,017
and force it to kill itself?

328
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:52,146
That's a Devilish way of thinking.

329
00:21:55,358 --> 00:21:58,152
