00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,910
Thors!

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,750
Helga!

3
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,010
Thors!

00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:07,500
YEAR 987 A.D. HJÖRUNGAVÁGR

5
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,870
What are you doing just standing there?

6
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,380
Are you unwell?

7
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,500
Sorry. I was just resting my eyes.

8
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,170
Our formation has spread out too far.

9
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,590
A second wave would overwhelm us.

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,850
Thorkell, I want you to push the front
when Floki comes closer to us.

11
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,230
That airhead, huh?

12
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,400
Well, I'll do it.

13
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,400
What about you?

14
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,190
I'll hold them back.

15
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,030
What do you mean?!

16
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,360
How can you do that from there--

17
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,120
He sure is nimble.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,410
Wait! A solo sneak attack?

19
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,950
Maria, I'm sorry…

20
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,640
EPISODE 1: SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY

21
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,580
YEAR 1002 A.D. ICELAND

22
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh, Thorfinn.
Please feed the sheep and milk the cows.

23
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,560
Okay.

24
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,740
With Markland behind us,
we sailed further south.

25
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
"There are richer lands there,"

26
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,290
the wind seemed to say.

27
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,800
And then, I found it.

28
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,800
A new continent!

29
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,060
A new land of bountiful fruit harvests
and waves of grassy meadows.

30
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,570
I gave the land a name.

31
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,030
I called it

32
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,910
"Vinland."

33
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,540
What do you think, you rascals?

34
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,960
Does that change your view of me?
The great Leif Erikson!

35
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,710
Wow, old man Leif!

36
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,920
What then?

37
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,800
-Were there people?
-Was it warm?

38
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,840
Was it bigger than Iceland?

39
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,140
It was indeed.

40
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,600
It was much warmer than here.

41
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,810
Grass covered the whole land.

42
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,480
We even met the native peoples.

43
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,530
We couldn't communicate with words,
but we became fast friends.

44
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:43,620
This headdress and this pipe
are gifts from them.

45
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,450
See this here?

46
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,500
Only a true warrior
can wear this upon his head.

47
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,180
What's this? The children are still awake?

48
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,180
-Let me touch it, old man!
-I'm sorry.

49
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,680
I wanted to let them
listen to Leif's story.

50
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,730
A true warrior, huh?

51
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,690
You really are amazing!

52
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,900
Aren't I? You're a good boy, Thorfinn.

53
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,820
When you're older,
would you like to sail on my ship?

54
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,570
What? Let me go with you now!

55
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,240
Now?

56
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,070
But something is strange, Leif.

57
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,580
My grandpa told me.

58
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,710
Jörmungandr is to the west,
and it eats any boat that comes near it.

59
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,210
And beyond that, nothing else exists.

60
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,170
That's precisely why

61
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,460
you should realize how impressive I am!

62
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,880
See? This proves that I am a true warrior.

63
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,600
But Leif, you're not even a warrior.

64
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,850
You don't get it, do you?

65
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,560
Merely going to war
doesn't make you a warrior!

66
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,520
To sail a ship is to fight the sea.

67
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,690
Isn't that amazing?

68
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,860
-Just as I thought.
-Yeah.

69
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,110
What?

70
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,320
Everyone says
you're just a child with a beard.

71
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,070
You only explore
but you're useless in battle.

72
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,830
Others speak for you?

73
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,580
Thorfinn, you believe me, don't you?

74
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,750
Or is it that

75
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,590
you can't believe an old adventurer
who doesn't gone to war?

76
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,470
If my dad said you were a warrior,
then I would believe it, but…

77
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,430
Thors!

78
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,310
These kids are mocking me!
Set them straight!

79
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,610
All right. That's enough for today.

80
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,320
Ari, take the kids home please.

81
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,900
Okay, Thors.

82
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,700
Bye!

83
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,700
See you!

84
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
I see.

85
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,930
They froze to death in Greenland…

86
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,510
The cold waves this year
are especially severe.

87
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,430
Much of the livestock will die, too.

88
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,690
But the problem is that with each year,
the cold becomes ever harsher.

89
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,570
It's so cold.

90
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,030
Welcome back.

91
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,570
Only these two were a little weak.

92
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,330
You must've been freezing out there, Ylva!

93
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,240
Let me warm you up.

94
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,450
You perverted old man!

95
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,830
Mother, go to sleep.
You'll catch another cold.

96
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,170
I will be fine.

97
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,590
-Come help me tie up the sheep.
-Okay.

98
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,630
It seems things are rough here, too.

99
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,340
Yeah.

100
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,930
Sooner or later, there may come a winter
that no one can survive.

101
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,480
At home, my younger brother
is making plans to migrate.

102
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,940
It's far, isn't it?

103
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,150
Come now.

104
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,440
I made a round trip.

105
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,280
Forward!

106
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,540
Vinland is just over yonder!

107
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,370
Captain Thorfinn!

108
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,660
What is it?

109
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,960
It's the Jörmungandr!

110
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,630
I'll take you on, beast!

111
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,630
It hurts.

112
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,770
Ylva! Go to your own bed!
You're crowding me!

113
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,690
What? I don't want to.

114
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,020
That's not fair!

115
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,320
I warmed this bed up!

116
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,490
They're still talking.

117
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,780
Don't worry about it.

118
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,080
Leave the worrying to the adults.

119
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,410
Anyway, come here.

120
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,460
I'll give you a nice, warm hug!

121
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,260
Goodness.

122
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,550
Hey, Father! Let's buy a slave?

123
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,850
Mother's not in good health,
and I'm always busy helping her.

124
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,560
We do things differently.

125
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,020
Stop asking.

126
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,480
You're so strange.

127
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,950
Ylva!

128
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,740
I thought I was going to die.

129
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,830
-Are you hurt?
-No.

130
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,370
What's wrong?

131
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,580
There's something underneath.

132
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,670
Ylva?

133
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,030
Hey, old man.

134
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,740
How much of last night's story was true?

135
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,330
"How much"? It's all true.

136
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,830
Then let me sail with you.

137
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,590
-I'll believe you when I see it myself.
-Fool.

138
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,880
You can't say that
just to get on the ship.

139
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,050
If you really want to sail
go with your father.

140
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,640
Look. That's a battleship.

141
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,930
The village has used it for generations,

142
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,770
but they'd gladly lend it to your father.

143
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,900
My father's stingy. No matter
how many times I ask, he says no.

144
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,030
He's not stingy.

145
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,110
That sea out there, Thorfinn,
is frightening.

146
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,540
When I was young,
I was once trapped by an ice floe.

147
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,410
It was right after we moved to Greenland.

148
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,750
We were reckless.

149
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,630
Our provisions depleted quickly.

150
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,380
We ate ice to distract ourselves
from starvation.

151
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,050
At last, the ship was crushed by the ice,

152
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,050
so with no choice,
we walked over the frozen sea.

153
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,230
Before I knew it, I was alone.

154
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,690
All six of my companions had died.

155
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,030
Why?

156
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,700
Why did we struggle so hard
just to live on these northern islands?

157
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,630
Helga! Boil some water!

158
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,830
Ylva, bring the furs.

159
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,790
Okay.

160
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,170
Oh dear. What happened?

161
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,800
He was buried in the snow.

162
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,480
That looks so painful.

163
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
What happened to him?

164
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,730
-Stoke the fire.
-Okay.

165
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,480
Hey, Father.

166
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,860
Isn't he already dead?

167
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,610
His limbs are rotting.

168
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,240
Besides, this could be bad.

169
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,450
He's…

170
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,450
He's not from this village.

171
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,040
Poor thing.

172
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,460
What was he doing out in that blizzard?

173
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,460
"What was he doing?"

174
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,590
He's a runaway slave.

175
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,130
Sheltering him could be trouble for us.

176
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,220
We were running away.

177
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,600
Our ancestors lived further east.

178
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,600
They lived in a land called Norway.

179
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,480
It's warmer than here,
and the sea doesn't freeze.

180
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:58,700
A beautiful land protected by many fjords.

181
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,240
But one day,

182
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,580
a strong man named Harald appeared.

183
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:10,040
Harald's forces burned through villages
on their conquests,

184
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:14,750
and he proclaimed himself
the first king of a unified Norway.

185
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,710
And he forced the people to choose.

186
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,390
Obey the king or leave Norway.

187
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,350
Many despised Harald's tyranny and left
to a faraway land far from oppression.

188
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,860
That land is here, Iceland.

189
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,360
You're lying.

190
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,860
You're just a liar after all!

191
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,240
My father and my ancestors
would never run away like that!

192
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,080
You foolish geezer!

193
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,540
Washed-up explorer!

194
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,470
Father!

195
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,260
Father, listen.

196
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,720
Old man Leif said…

197
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,570
Welcome home, Thorfinn.

198
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
Who is that?

199
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,240
A slave from somewhere else.
He's a runaway.

200
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,280
He woke up!

201
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,120
Can you tell me your name?

202
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,250
It's cold.

203
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,340
The fire! Ylva, stoke it more.

204
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,750
Okay.

205
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,510
Where did you come from?

206
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,510
W-Will I…

207
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,050
be sent back?

208
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,520
To Halfdan's… home…

209
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,060
Halfdan?

210
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,190
So you are from beyond the mountains?

211
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,360
I hate that place.

212
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,650
I hate it.

213
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,900
But…

214
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,450
I have…

215
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,280
nowhere else to go.

216
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,170
Thors!

217
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,790
Come quickly. Halfdan's at the harbor!

218
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,170
He brought his men
and they're blaming us for something.

219
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,800
Only you can face him!

220
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,840
They want to know about a slave
and forced their way on land.

221
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,390
Leif is holding him back,

222
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,970
but a fight could break out at any moment!

223
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,640
Please, come fast!

224
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:45,150
Chains are the only adornment
that suits a man's neck.

225
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,360
Not gold, not silver,

226
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,660
but iron chains.

227
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,540
Only a chained neck

228
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,410
can make a man more civilized.

229
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,500
Don't you think?

230
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,640
Last night, one of my slaves
broke his chain and escaped.

231
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,350
Any idea where he could be?

232
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't pick a fight with us!

233
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,600
You're just trying
to bring up an old quarrel!

234
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,230
He's always having disagreements with us.

235
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,980
We had an intervention last time.

236
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,440
Brat. I remember you.

237
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,860
You cut off my left arm during that fight!

238
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,570
Speak for yourself.

239
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,240
How dare you
cut off my elder brother's leg!

240
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,620
That's enough, Ari!

241
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,080
My brother will never walk again!

242
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,250
I'll slice off your leg too!

243
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,540
Come at me!

244
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,920
Your people and your laws mean nothing!

245
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,800
Halfdan.

246
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,310
I'll chain you up, bastard.

247
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,070
Anyone who mocks the law is unforgivable.

248
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,150
The law is the chain.

249
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,080
When brutes are chained,
they become men for the first time.

250
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,370
Do not forget that.

251
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,090
The runaway is a young Slavic man.

252
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,920
Any idea where he is?

253
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,140
Where am I?

254
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,610
This is the first time
I've felt so at peace.

255
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,280
Stay with us! Hold on!

256
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,410
Keep conscious or else you'll die!

257
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,200
Thors.

258
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,160
Father.

259
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,250
Mother.

260
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,250
Sister.

261
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,210
You are all here?

262
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
I was worried.

263
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,180
Each of us was sold alone.

264
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,050
Where is this place?

265
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,930
Why am I…

266
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,360
Far to the west

267
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,270
and beyond the sea

268
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,320
is a land called Vinland.

269
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,530
It is a warm…

270
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,950
plentiful far away place

271
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,370
where slave traders
and the flames of war cannot reach.

272
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,710
How about it?

273
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,090
Would you like to live there
with us someday?

274
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,260
Vinland.

275
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,560
I see.

276
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,680
This place

277
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,520
is called Vinland.

278
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,950
Found him.

279
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:22,660
Forgive the ruckus, Thors.

280
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,920
I am the legitimate owner of that slave.

281
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:27,880
Return him to me.

282
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,130
F-Father…

283
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,510
Come along, Thorfinn.

284
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,760
Halfdan!

285
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,390
We can explain.

286
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,390
We weren't hiding him.

287
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,770
Actually, we saved your slave
from near death.

288
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,690
Halfdan. How much
did you pay for this man?

289
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,900
F-Father,

290
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,990
it's rude to ask such a question.

291
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,150
Two young ewes.

292
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,910
I'll give you three. I will buy him.

293
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,660
How about it, Halfdan?

294
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,460
I will be taking him home with me.

295
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,210
I must make an example of him
to the other slaves.

296
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,340
Then I'll pay you four.

297
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,850
Bastard! Do you not understand
what Master Halfdan is saying?

298
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,010
Silence.

299
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,270
And if I ask for double that?

300
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,230
I'll pay it.

301
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,020
All males under three years old.

302
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,280
Eight sheep for this worthless bastard.

303
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,950
A good deal.

304
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,290
No way. It's settled?

305
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Thors.

306
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,300
Do you plan to free him from his chains?

307
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,550
Where will you take him then?

308
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,980
I'll choose the sheep myself.

309
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,870
Ylva, are you sad?

310
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,160
Of course I am!

311
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,830
He gave away eight sheep
and the man died anyway!

312
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,590
You idiot, Father!

313
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,800
Why are you so strange?

314
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,220
Father.

315
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,970
Did we run away too?

316
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:49,640
Old man Leif said our ancestors
ran away from the east.

317
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,600
He said they ran away and came here.

318
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,650
Yes.

319
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,820
That is what has been told.

320
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,780
Then…

321
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,500
Then…

322
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,380
if people want to escape here too…

323
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,880
where do they go?

324
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,970
