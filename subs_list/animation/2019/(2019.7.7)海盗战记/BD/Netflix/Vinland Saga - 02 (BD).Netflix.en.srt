1
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,950
NORTHUMBRIA, NORTHERN ENGLAND
VIKING SITE

2
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,030
It was a Saturday.

3
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,540
Vikings bathe on Saturdays.

4
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,590
The English were aware of this custom.

5
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
An enemy attack!

6
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
Burn it all! Spare no one,
not even the women and children!

7
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,240
By the king's order, kill them all!

8
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,840
Stand your ground!
This is the turning point!

9
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,930
I killed Snorre!

10
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,680
Damn it.

11
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,310
Spear group to the front!

12
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,940
Charge!

13
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,280
The battlefield went that way.

14
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,660
Why do I always get killed so soon?

15
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,790
Corpses aren't
supposed to talk, Thorfinn.

16
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,040
You always just die, Faxi.

17
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,420
Yeah.

18
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,420
But after I die, I'll get to eat meat
every day in Valhalla.

19
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,390
You can't go to Valhalla
if you're not a strong warrior.

20
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,510
I see.

21
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,440
I wonder if Mother and Ylva
can go to Valhalla.

22
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,450
Were you defeated, Thorfinn?

23
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,910
You'll catch a cold dying in the snow.

24
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,660
You're leaving tomorrow?

25
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,670
You're so lucky.
Where are you going this time?

26
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,500
To Norway. I'm not going for fun.

27
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,420
I'm going to trade.

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,170
I'll exchange woolen goods
and furs for wine.

29
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,930
Then I'll come too!

30
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,260
No.

31
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,180
"Then I'll come too"?
It's not for you to decide.

32
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,850
What an oaf.

33
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,390
Don't blame me if you hit an ice floe.

34
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,860
I want wine for the end of the year.

35
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,150
The people of my homeland drink wine
to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.

36
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,280
My father likes mead.
Why don't you ask him to share with you?

37
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,370
But there's a meaning to drinking wine.

38
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,460
I thought maybe
this village would have wine.

39
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,630
Thorfinn.

40
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,260
Run to your father
and deliver a message.

41
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,590
A battleship has arrived.

42
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,780
What do you think of this, master?

43
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,780
The hole should be sealed now.

44
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,740
Try filling it with water.

45
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,290
This isn't easy to fix.

46
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,500
You hit it too hard, Thors.

47
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,870
Father!

48
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,540
Father!

49
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,210
I'm here, Thorfinn.

50
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Father!

51
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,380
Another battleship sailed in.
A really big one!

52
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,070
They're asking for Thors the Troll
and that's all.

53
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,530
By "Thors," do they mean that Thors?

54
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,660
The Troll?

55
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,660
These men seem highly trained.

56
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,040
They look different from Halfdan's thugs.

57
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,040
Oh, Thors!

58
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,790
Are they going to attack the village?

59
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,130
Jomsvikings! I have come.

60
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,310
They're bowing to Thors.

61
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,360
I didn't think you would
venture this far to find me,

62
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,530
Floki.

63
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,240
It's been a long time
since the Norway campaign, Thors.

64
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,710
I didn't think you'd be hiding
at the end of the world.

65
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,090
State your purpose, Floki.

66
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,760
Then please grant us permission to land.

67
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,340
I wonder who exactly Thors is.

68
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,260
I heard he fought
in several wars in his youth.

69
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,350
You're too loud, Ari.

70
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,310
He never speaks about himself.

71
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,650
Hey, let me see too!

72
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,400
He called them "Jomsvikings," didn't he?

73
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,190
-Do you know who they are?
-No idea.

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,450
Father seems a little angry.

75
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,490
They were ambushed while bathing.

76
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,420
Danes throughout the Danelaw
were murdered by the English army.

77
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,300
And among them was Gunhilde,

78
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,260
the younger sister of Sweyn,
king of the Danes.

79
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
Revenge for his sister.

80
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,760
King Sweyn now has an excellent reason.

81
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,430
A great war will begin.

82
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,060
As warriors, it is our time.

83
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,100
War?

84
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,650
The Jomsvikings will align
with the Danish army.

85
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,280
We will launch an attack
on England next spring.

86
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,870
Do as you wish.

87
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,120
This is a small village in the far north.

88
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,250
What other countries do beyond
the North Sea does not involve us.

89
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,710
That won't do.

90
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,670
Our leader Sigvaldi's orders are
to gather the whole Jomsviking armada.

91
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,180
There are no exceptions.

92
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,470
You understand, right?

93
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,390
That also includes deserters.

94
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,390
Deserters?

95
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,490
Battalion commander of the Jomsvikings,
Thors the Troll.

96
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,740
In this war, too…

97
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,870
you will take part.

98
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,880
Thors, think of it
as a kindness from our leader.

99
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,890
For 15 years, you've been missing,
but you'll be welcomed back in battle.

100
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,900
He is willing to overlook
your past transgressions.

101
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,940
That is how much
our leader values your ability.

102
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,570
You came all this way
in a warship to tell me that?

103
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
You've agitated the villagers.

104
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,910
You've certainly changed, Thors.

105
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,210
Or perhaps this village changed you?

106
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,840
-Run!
-Run away!

107
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,170
That was a close one.

108
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,010
This is a good village.

109
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,140
I can tell by the children.

110
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,270
So far, the tribulations of war
haven't touched their lives.

111
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,650
Did you hear that? A war!

112
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,650
-Wow!
-My first one!

113
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,280
They crossed the sea
just to call on Thors to fight.

114
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,870
Your father's incredible.

115
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,370
But do you think he'll take us with him?

116
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,370
Not you. You're too weak.

117
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,540
What did you say?

118
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:17,040
You're no use if you're not strong.

119
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,880
Well, on that front, I'll be fine.

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,010
None of you have killed a man.
If you have that experience--

121
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,050
Sorry.

122
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,360
I, too,

123
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,070
don't want to run a fool's errand.

124
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,240
If you tell me
you won't fight in this war,

125
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,240
I'll fail to fulfill our leader's orders,
and make him lose face.

126
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,120
I cannot leave empty-handed.

127
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,830
You understand, don't you?

128
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,890
The Jomsvikings.

129
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,770
They're a battalion based in the port town
of Jomsborg in Vendland.

130
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,270
It's hard to believe that Thors was once
a Jomsviking long ago.

131
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,730
Are they strong?

132
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,730
They are.

133
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,320
They're so strong, the king of Vendland
cannot make them pay taxes.

134
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,280
They are proud
of being the strongest in the North Sea.

135
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,910
Withdraw! All units back to the ship!

136
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,790
Withdraw!

137
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,720
What was that?
That guy gives me the creeps.

138
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,510
You were spared, Ari.

139
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,350
Listen well, people of this village.

140
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,770
I am the Jomsviking Floki.

141
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,690
By my master's orders,

142
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,070
I have come to request assistance
from the brave Thors Snorresson.

143
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,820
Brave.

144
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,870
In response to our leader's request,

145
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,990
Thors has promised to deploy one warship.

146
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Those of you who are confident,
sail with Thors to Jomsborg!

147
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,470
Thors, I will meet you on the battlefield!

148
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,150
War!

149
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,020
Amazing!

150
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,860
How many years has it been?

151
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,150
We'll kill them all!

152
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,910
It's every man's dream
to die on the battlefield!

153
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,790
It's decided. Tomorrow, we ready the ship!

154
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,700
Yeah!

155
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,920
You couldn't refuse, could you, Thors?

156
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,170
All the village has been dragged into it.

157
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,970
I was once very good at killing people.

158
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,470
But then one day…

159
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,020
One day, I was suddenly sick of it.

160
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,110
Kill… or be killed.

161
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,110
That's why I fled

162
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,150
from the battlefield.

163
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,580
I thought I had
faked my death well enough.

164
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,960
Why not try it again?

165
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,170
If I run away, they'll take revenge
on this village in my place.

166
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,010
The Jomsviking code
does not forgive deserters.

167
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,060
The time has come for me
to take responsibility for what I've done.

168
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,650
Get ready to pull!

169
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,870
Ready, set!

170
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,910
Heave-ho!

171
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,410
-Heave-ho!
-Pull!

172
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,660
Heave-ho!

173
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,290
Leif, I thought you were departing today.

174
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,670
Thors asked me to wait.

175
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,510
I'll be sailing alongside that warship.

176
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,670
Is that so?

177
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,050
That's certainly safer.

178
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,050
If anything happens, we'll protect you!

179
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,930
I'll be counting on you.

180
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,850
Pull!

181
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,070
They all seem real excited about the war.

182
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,280
That hurt!

183
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,620
That damn Thorfinn!

184
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,830
Surround him!

185
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,540
Jerk!

186
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,170
We did it! We got Thorfinn!

187
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,050
It hurts!

188
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,920
What are you doing?
Die,Thorfinn! You were just killed!

189
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,590
Follow the rules.

190
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,680
-Yeah!
-That's right!

191
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,390
What's with him?

192
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,510
Are you alright?

193
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,430
Wait a minute, Thorfinn!

194
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,070
All right. Raise it!

195
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,900
One, two, three!

196
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,820
All right. Once more!

197
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,700
Thors!

198
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,830
Could you look at something for me?

199
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,790
It's broken.

200
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,040
You played too roughly for children.

201
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,760
Keep this splint on for a month.

202
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,880
Sorry, Thors.

203
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,430
Thorfinn did it!

204
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,550
He's been a pain lately.

205
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,890
He's out of control.
We're not playing with him anymore!

206
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,480
Really? My son?

207
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,390
Yeah.

208
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,350
I'm sorry about that.

209
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,610
I'll have a word with him.

210
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,280
Don't worry about the kids.

211
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,740
He's only six but can hurt kids
four or five years older.

212
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,160
That's impressive.

213
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,910
He'll grow up to be an excellent warrior.

214
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,830
He really is your son, Thors.

215
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,220
Wow!

216
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,470
You're giving me all of this, Father?

217
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,520
They're all from your grandfather's time.

218
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,430
Fight to your heart's content!

219
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Ari!

220
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,100
You look amazing, Ari!

221
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,770
Look what I got!

222
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,280
This beauty can slice the head
off a horse with one swing.

223
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,860
Wow, it's huge!

224
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,410
-But my spear's a superior weapon.
-Really? Wanna fight?

225
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,160
Hey, wait a minute!

226
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,420
Didn't I tell you to pick up your things?
Are you listening?

227
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,710
Clean this up or I'll throw it out!
Is that what you want?

228
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,420
Fine. I don't want it.

229
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,470
What are you doing
rummaging in the storage?

230
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,140
Where is my weapon?

231
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,770
What weapon?

232
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,180
I need a weapon.

233
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,770
If I had one…

234
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:37,400
Do you think Father will take you
on the ship if you have a weapon?

235
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,900
I'll tell you now,
you're wasting your time.

236
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,700
You're just a puny child.

237
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,950
Thorfinn?

238
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,710
It's beautiful.

239
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,970
What's going on, Ylva?

240
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,640
Do you desire a sword, Thorfinn?

241
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,360
Swords are tools for killing.

242
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,650
Who do you intend to kill with this?

243
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,530
The enemy.

244
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,290
What enemies do you have?

245
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,160
H…

246
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,210
Halfdan.

247
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,380
Listen to me, Thorfinn.

248
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,260
You do not have enemies.

249
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,190
No one has enemies.

250
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,940
There are no people it is right to kill.

251
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,990
That's not true.

252
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,450
Aren't you leaving for war tomorrow?

253
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,170
Will you not kill the enemy?

254
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,540
I'm not a child.

255
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,300
You're lying to me.

256
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,670
I know you are!

257
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,840
Thorfinn!

258
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,300
Thorfinn!

259
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,310
-Got you!
-Watch it!

260
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,610
Helga.

261
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,940
Yes?

262
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,320
Take care of him for me.

263
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,180
A west-northwest breeze and gentle waves.

264
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:57,100
Odin is in great spirits this morning.

265
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,310
It's a good morning to depart.

266
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,980
Yes.

267
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,200
STREYMOY ISLAND, FAROE ISLANDS

268
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,250
As I said, if I hit the mark
with a left-handed throw

269
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,080
that wine barrel is mine.

270
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,370
Oh, shut up.

271
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,080
-Hit it and then talk.
-Please.

272
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,590
Here I go, Christian monk.

273
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,590
Don't move, or I'll kill you.

274
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,300
You moved! You dodged it!

275
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,470
-I'll kill you!
-Move. It's my turn.

276
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:41,850
The priest.

277
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,270
I told you not to move!

278
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,190
You're terrible at this!

279
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,240
Hey, Jomsvikings.

280
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,240
Want a drink?

281
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,330
-They're serious, aren't they?
-Let them be.

282
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,750
They don't like cheap wine.

283
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,390
Your men
are as reckless as ever, Askeladd.

284
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:20,060
They merely dislike Christians, Floki.

285
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,150
More importantly,
tell me about this job you have.

286
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:30,490
My men and I have been bored
waiting for you in this backcountry.

287
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,570
There are no major changes.

288
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,200
Compensation is five pounds of gold.

289
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,290
You won't be paid
until you produce the body.

290
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,090
You may do what you wish
with his ships and cargo.

291
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,050
Kill Thors.

292
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
