ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,925
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,884
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,394
Hey!

5
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,564
It's poison!

6
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,027
You bastard! Who gave you the order?!

7
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,113
Wait.

8
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,157
First, we must treat the soldiers.

9
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,379
-Poison?
-The meal was prepared in the village.

10
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,714
We've captured the village chief

11
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,218
for siding with the foreigners.
We're awaiting your orders.

12
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,346
Understood. Give me some time.

13
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,305
Yes, sir.

14
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,391
Also…

15
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,518
I hear that you hired

16
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,229
a new lady-in-waiting
for Concubine Gyokuyou's palace.

17
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,480
Yes.

18
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,816
Concubine Gyokuyou has four attendants.

19
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,360
<i>Another high-ranking concubine,</i>

20
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>Concubine Lihua, has more than ten.</i>
<i>It's far too few.</i>

21
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>She has to maintain</i>
<i>her honor as a high-ranking concubine.</i>

22
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,577
<i>Yes.</i>

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,372
<i>However, although Concubine Gyokuyou</i>
<i>is a cheerful and calm woman,</i>

24
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,666
<i>she is also intelligent and cautious.</i>

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,045
I wouldn't hire just anyone
as her attendant.

26
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,173
Being the Emperor's favorite means

27
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,342
she has to remain suspicious all the time.

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,428
Her life is always at risk.

29
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,306
So, who is this new attendant?

30
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,185
Gaoshun, I found the perfect chess piece.

31
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,730
It's that freckled maidservant.

32
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,736
She's knowledgeable about medicine.
We can use that.

33
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,070
I see.

34
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,698
But what if she uses that knowledge
against us?

35
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,118
We just have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

36
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,745
It's easy.

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,582
<i>Just to be safe, I can use seduction.</i>

38
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,421
I'm so jealous you get to attend to
a high-ranking concubine!

39
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,673
I'm not happy about this.

40
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,258
Huh?

41
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,388
Apothecary.

42
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,557
Are you prepared for your move?

43
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,685
Yes. I'm heading to the Jade Pavilion
soon.

44
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,395
Did you need anything?

45
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,939
No, I don't need anything.

46
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,023
What?

47
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,818
<i>Then why is he here?</i>
<i>Does he have nothing better to do?</i>

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,867
Serve Concubine Gyokuyou diligently.

49
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,957
Excuse me.

50
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,751
Good luck, Maomao!

51
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,257
So gross…

52
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,221
You're Maomao?

53
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,056
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm the head lady-in-waiting
for Lady Gyokuyou, Hongniang.

55
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,772
I'll show you around the Jade Pavilion.
Come with me.

56
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,524
Yes.

57
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,989
Welcome to the Jade Pavilion.

58
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,866
We were waiting for you, Maomao.

59
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,870
Looks like Xiaoling welcomes you too.

60
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,415
I look forward to having you around.

61
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,211
Yes, ma'am.

62
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,047
Here is the reception room.

63
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,133
This is where we welcome the guests.

64
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,718
So big…

65
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,471
Here is the kitchen.
We can make simple meals here.

66
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,725
Here's the living room.

67
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,101
Let me introduce everyone.

68
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,270
All the Jade Pavilion attendants.

69
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,022
Gather around, everyone!

70
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,148
Yes, ma'am!

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,026
Nice to meet you, I'm Yinghua.

72
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,777
Ask me anything, all right?

73
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,990
Hello, I'm Guiyuan. Nice to meet you.

74
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,908
I'm Ailan.

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
It's very nice to meet you.

76
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm Maomao. Thank you for having me.

77
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,377
We don't hire maidservants
at the Jade Pavilion.

78
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,839
So we split the tasks
and do them ourselves.

79
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,133
It's the least we can do for Lady Gyokuyou

80
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,968
so that she can be comfortable.

81
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,845
-Then I will also…
-Oh!

82
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,848
You relax in your room.

83
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,767
Just be comfortable.

84
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,519
Since you'll be doing the special task.

85
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,937
"Special task"?

86
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,275
-Maomao, I'll show you to your room.
-All right.

87
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,448
Did you see her left arm?

88
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,243
She tried her best to hide it
with bandages, but it's scarred, right?

89
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,954
She was probably abused by her parents
back at home,

90
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,457
and was sold off to the rear palace.

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,919
And to top it all off,
she'll be doing such hard tasks…

92
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,839
Oh, that poor girl!

93
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:28,137
-Just stay put until you're called.
-Um…

94
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,854
Seems like I got promoted
way up the ranks.

95
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,567
<i>The Jade Pavilion had</i>
<i>a small team of staff.</i>

96
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,071
<i>I knew they wouldn't be welcoming</i>
<i>to newcomers.</i>

97
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,240
But those eyes…

98
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,910
Pity?

99
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
Why?

100
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,124
Poison tester.

101
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,335
That's your job, Apothecary.

102
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,462
<i>Poison…</i>

103
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,714
<i>Poison tester?</i>

104
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,050
<i>No, stay calm.</i>

105
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,346
The meals prepared for the concubines

106
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,183
are handled by several people
before being carried in here.

107
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,273
There's a chance of the meal being
poisoned during this process.

108
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,277
When Concubine Gyokuyou became pregnant,
her meal was

109
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,612
poisoned twice.

110
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,117
<i>The poison tester back then,</i>
<i>an attendant, got nerve damaged and</i>

111
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,369
<i>her arms and legs are still paralyzed.</i>

112
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,374
<i>I see. That's why the attendants pity me…</i>

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,960
All right, then.

114
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,503
If you will.

115
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,423
<i>This bowl…</i>

116
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>No abnormality in color.</i>

117
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:50,803
<i>No strange odors.</i>

118
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
<i>No numbness, either.</i>

119
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,437
This doesn't seem to be poisoned.

120
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,900
<i>Back at home in the pleasure district,</i>

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>I tested various poisons on my arms,</i>
<i>calling them "experiments."</i>

122
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,615
This mad scientist…

123
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,243
<i>I slowly got my body adjusted to poison,</i>

124
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,829
<i>so most types of poison don't work on me.</i>

125
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>Honestly, I'm not suited for the role</i>
<i>of a poison tester.</i>

126
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>But in a way, I was very lucky</i>
<i>to get this position.</i>

127
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,590
She's laughing…

128
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,219
I think you should serve the meals

129
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,930
in silver bowls,
since it reacts to poison.

130
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,058
Sir Jinshi was right.

131
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,937
We used ceramic bowls on purpose.
He wanted to test you.

132
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,565
<i>This was that man's plot all along?</i>

133
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,570
Your skills can truly become
poison and medicine.

134
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,323
I was an apothecary by profession.

135
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,367
If we knew you could write,

136
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,203
you could've gotten a higher salary.

137
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,330
I was kidnapped and brought here.

138
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,626
It infuriates me to think that
the kidnappers are still being sent

139
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,336
a part of my salary.

140
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,131
You're saying you don't want to give
them drinking money

141
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,009
so badly that you would cut down
your own salary.

142
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:25,189
Oh, no! This is very expensive.

143
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,150
An attendant's salary can't
possibly pay for this.

144
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,945
You can't even send an allowance
back home.

145
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,282
I should be asking you for money.

146
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,161
Oh, no! I'm sorry, ma'am.

147
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,039
Please take away money from my allowance.

148
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,916
If it's not enough, take away my savings.

149
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,461
All right. I'll handle the paperwork.

150
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,380
Also…

151
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,217
An added salary for poison testers.
It's danger money.

152
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,304
<i>About the same pay as my current salary…</i>

153
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,848
<i>Because there's no money going</i>
<i>to the kidnappers,</i>

154
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,349
<i>it's actually a raise.</i>

155
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,311
Thank you, ma'am.

156
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>She's good at using her carrots.</i>

157
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,452
It's fine!

158
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,245
Just rest!

159
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,247
We already had enough people anyways.

160
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,499
I'm so bored!

161
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,794
<i>I'm only called upon as a poison tester</i>

162
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,839
<i>for the two meals and teatime at noon.</i>

163
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,300
<i>I finally have my own room.</i>

164
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>If I had some poisonous snakes,</i>
<i>I could do experiments…</i>

165
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,847
-Maomao?
-Oink?

166
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,100
Did you call for me, Lady Gyokuyou?

167
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,602
He called for you.

168
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,899
Why won't it work on her?

169
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,906
What business do you have today?

170
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,326
I received this from a soldier.

171
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,619
Can you taste test it?

172
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,245
Bao buns?

173
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,461
It contains an aphrodisiac.

174
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,922
You know without eating it?

175
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,049
It won't have any impact on your health.

176
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,009
You're free to enjoy these.

177
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:21,055
Considering who gave them to me,
I can't just eat these…

178
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:25,309
You may get
a visit from that person tonight.

179
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,187
Disappointing. She can tell
just by the smell?

180
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>This man… He knew it contained</i>
<i>an aphrodisiac</i>

181
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,401
<i>and tried to make me eat it?</i>

182
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,910
I want to ask you one other thing.

183
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,329
What is it?

184
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,372
The other day,

185
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,041
there was a foreign combat troop
out on an expedition.

186
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,168
-They were poisoned.
-Poisoned?

187
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,255
Many of the soldiers that ate the meal

188
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,634
had symptoms of nausea
and difficulty breathing. Many got sick.

189
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,429
Nausea and difficulty breathing?

190
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,807
<i>The meal was prepared at a nearby village.</i>

191
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,019
<i>The village head was captured</i>
<i>for siding with the foreigners,</i>

192
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,523
<i>but one soldier controlled the situation,</i>
<i>and the punishment remains undecided.</i>

193
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,109
<i>Normally, one would think</i>

194
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:18,821
<i>that the villagers poisoned the meal, but…</i>

195
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,535
Sir Jinshi, where was this meal eaten?

196
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,287
They were camping, so outside.

197
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,999
Were the bowls, chopsticks, and spoons
prepared by villagers as well?

198
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,627
No, the soldiers prepared it themselves.

199
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,797
Have you realized something?

200
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,801
This is just an opinion.

201
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
This flower is called a rhododendron.

202
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,932
Is it tasty?

203
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,603
No. If you eat it, you get
nausea and difficulty breathing.

204
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,687
Hey!

205
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:56,609
As you can see, there are many
poisonous plants even in the rear palace.

206
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,694
With these, the leaves are poisonous,

207
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,988
but some have poison
in the branches and roots.

208
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:05,242
Some plants become poisonous
from burning the raw wood.

209
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,869
Just by burning it?

210
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,957
I see…

211
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,503
It was good that a rational soldier
was present.

212
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,297
He prevented one village
from being burned down.

213
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:19,965
Yes…

214
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,886
-If we're finished here, I'm off.
-No, wait.

215
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,513
Is there anything else?

216
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,601
Will you make a stimulant potion?

217
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,063
<i>Make a potion? In other words…</i>

218
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>Medicine preparation?</i>

219
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,116
With time, the ingredients, and the tools,

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,994
I can make something with that effect.

221
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,706
Sir Jinshi. Where are you off to?

222
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,128
I'm returning to my office.

223
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,755
Can I help you?

224
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,800
It's nothing…
Would you like some tea in my room?

225
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,345
Unfortunately, I have work left to do.
Excuse me.

226
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,353
<i>I wonder if the palace women</i>
<i>really haven't realized</i>

227
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,606
that you are an investigator
who measures their loyalty

228
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,233
to the Emperor.

229
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,946
Inviting other men to bed
because the Emperor will not visit them…

230
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,074
-How imprudent.
-Truly.

231
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,203
A concubine cannot just be beautiful
and well-educated.

232
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,583
They need to be loyal to the Emperor
and be chaste.

233
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,002
Placing you in the rear palace

234
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,881
to use your beauty
as a test for the concubines' loyalty…

235
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,592
The Lord can be cruel.

236
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,343
He uses what he can.

237
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,973
However… Not only was she not
tempted by me, but she saw me

238
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,434
with those eyes…

239
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,771
It's the first time I was regarded
with such contempt!

240
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,108
I'll be off then.

241
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,449
You may get a visit tonight…

242
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,911
<i>A visit… A visit…</i>

243
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,248
I'll be off then.

244
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,460
-Yes. Good luck.
-Yes, ma'am!

245
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,592
Excuse me.

246
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,178
<i>The quack doctor, and…</i>

247
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,140
Hello. Let me introduce myself.

248
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,600
My name is Gaoshun.

249
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,811
I usually work as an aide to Sir Jinshi.

250
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,647
Nice to meet you.

251
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Hello.

252
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>It must be hard to be an aide to "that"…</i>

253
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,363
She's just an attendant… Why…?

254
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,907
Intruding in my territory…

255
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,785
Right this way.

256
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,458
You're free to use
whatever you'd like in here.

257
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,638
Is that some kind of cursed dance?

258
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,312
<i>What a luxury to be able to use</i>
<i>this much paper.</i>

259
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,606
All right, next up…

260
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,275
This, right?

261
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,278
<i>He's very observant.</i>

262
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,364
<i>Compared to him, his master…</i>

263
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,451
<i>If you're not doing anything, go away!</i>

264
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,744
Here you are.

265
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,372
Thank you.

266
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
It's not enough…

267
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,920
-What is this?
-This is cocoa.

268
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,715
If this isn't enough, just get more.

269
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:51,844
These are obtained from
the southern lands of the Far West.

270
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,222
We should be able to find it
among the trade items.

271
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,189
Milk, butter,

272
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,568
sugar, honey, and powdered cocoa.

273
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,611
All this should be enough.

274
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,156
It's all expensive items.

275
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,658
I wonder what she's making?

276
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,076
Maybe a snack!

277
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,287
What are you three doing?

278
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,041
-Get back to work!
-We're sorry!

279
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,877
Geez!

280
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,755
Now, time to prepare the stimulant potion!

281
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,928
<i>I've eaten cocoa once before.</i>

282
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,431
This is called chocolate, Maomao.

283
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,977
Maomao?

284
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,024
<i>An evil customer gifted it</i>
<i>to win the affection</i>

285
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,817
<i>of a popular courtesan,</i>

286
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,821
<i>but unfortunately, he was banned</i>
<i>from ever entering by Grams.</i>

287
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,156
All set.

288
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,200
I'll chill these, and…

289
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,454
Now, I have to wait for it to harden.

290
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
There's some left over.

291
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,249
I know!

292
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,921
No need to chill these.

293
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,176
Now, I'll do the dishes.

294
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,390
Are those medicinal herbs?

295
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,435
Here! And here, too! And here!

296
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,148
I lost track of time.

297
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,275
I'm sorry for being late!

298
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,486
Huh?

299
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,739
What?

300
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
At least, now I know it works.

301
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,834
What's going on?

302
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,336
There's nothing to explain…

303
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,589
It's all right.
They haven't done anything…

304
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,219
So this is the stimulant we discussed?

305
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,055
No. These are for you.

306
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,392
So what is this?

307
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,935
These are my snacks.

308
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,981
If you're used to alcohol and stimulants,

309
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,607
the effects are not strong.

310
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,070
I see, in that case,
there should be no trouble if I eat these.

311
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,114
-Please don't!
-Please don't!

312
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,534
I'm kidding.

313
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,413
<i>What an inappropriate statement</i>
<i>in front of the Emperor's favorite.</i>

314
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:29,251
<i>But if that face came to tempt you</i>
<i>with flushed cheeks…</i>

315
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,882
<i>I'm sure that</i>
<i>most men and women couldn't resist.</i>

316
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,341
<i>He's pointlessly beautiful.</i>

317
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,263
The effects are strong,
so please have only one at a time.

318
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,015
Too much will circulate your blood

319
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,808
and give you a nosebleed.

320
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:48,187
Maybe I'll request some for the Emperor
one day.

321
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,771
I have to keep it spicy.

322
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,483
It should be three times more powerful
than regular tonics…

323
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,777
Three times?

324
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,946
You mean, he'd last three times as long?

325
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,990
<i>I'll pretend I didn't hear.</i>

326
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,492
Also, please only use this

327
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,495
when you're alone with your love interest.

328
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,538
I see.

329
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,792
All right. I'll be taking my leave now.

330
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,548
She can make medicine, huh?

331
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,759
She's very reliable.

332
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,723
I'm finally finished…

333
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,481
You worked hard.

334
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,823
Thank you.

335
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,705
I see.

336
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,667
I hope there won't be any victims…

337
