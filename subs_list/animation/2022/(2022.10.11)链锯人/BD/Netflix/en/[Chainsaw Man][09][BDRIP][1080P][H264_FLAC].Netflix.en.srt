1
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:46,340
Aki…

2
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:48,842
Don't die.

3
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:56,058
When I die…

4
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,811
I hope you can cry for me.

5
00:00:58,894 --> 00:01:00,646
Snake, swallow it.

6
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,244
Return.

7
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,016
The Fiend ran away.

8
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,144
We just need Chainsaw's heart.

9
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:41,520
No need to go after her.

10
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:05,627
I'll cut him in half this time.

11
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:08,464
Don't damage his heart.

12
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:12,468
I don't really get this.

13
00:02:13,886 --> 00:02:18,891
But I think it's safe to say
you are bad guys.

14
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,062
I just love bad guys.

15
00:02:23,687 --> 00:02:27,483
Because nobody's gonna complain
when I kill them.

16
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:31,945
I'll put you down again.

17
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:53,258
Die!

18
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:23,098
CHAINSAW MAN

19
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,398
This is Sawatari.

20
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:33,484
We're fighting with Chainsaw

21
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,486
on the third floor of
the west Nerima building.

22
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,571
Bring backup.

23
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,212
Take this!

24
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,058
Ow!

25
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,458
Do we shoot, sir?

26
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,211
Aim for his arms or his heart.

27
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,047
Yeah?

28
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:44,888
Bastards!

29
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:50,978
That really hurts!

30
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:52,229
What?

31
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,689
When did I get cut?

32
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:57,317
That hurts!

33
00:05:59,987 --> 00:06:01,738
Hey! Bad guy!

34
00:06:02,489 --> 00:06:04,533
This guy is one of you, right?

35
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,035
What if he is?

36
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,539
If you move even one millimeter,

37
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:15,043
his face is gonna turn into mincemeat.

38
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,046
You little piece of…

39
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:22,801
That's right.

40
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,177
Just stay there.

41
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:28,557
He disappeared?

42
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,699
I'll carry him.

43
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:47,743
You go get the car.

44
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,747
Hurry up.

45
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,127
Although Chainsaw's friends
should all be shot dead by now…

46
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,766
Devil Hunters are only human.

47
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,770
They can't win against guns.

48
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:43,799
They have guns…

49
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,096
We're almost at the station.

50
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,515
Move to another carriage and
blend in with the civilians.

51
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,609
KYOTO STATION

52
00:08:08,657 --> 00:08:09,700
Ms. Tendo.

53
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:16,540
We got word that Special Divisions 1, 2,
3, and 4 were all ambushed in Tokyo.

54
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:17,874
What?

55
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,376
No way.

56
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:21,169
Is Ms. Makima dead?

57
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,463
So we waited here for nothing?

58
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,415
Kurose.

59
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:00,083
Tendo.

60
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:04,004
I came under gunfire on the bullet train.

61
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:06,256
There are bodies that
need to be cleaned up.

62
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,133
The luncheon is canceled.

63
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,844
There was gunfire in Tokyo too…

64
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,596
Ms. Makima, that blood…

65
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,306
Were you shot?

66
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:16,558
It's not mine.

67
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:19,060
I wasn't shot.

68
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,623
Seems like it's total chaos over there.

69
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:41,917
We haven't got any specifics.

70
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,837
Checking the casualties right now.

71
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:47,923
Excuse me…

72
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:50,342
Should we go to Tokyo to assist?

73
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,678
We won't make it in time.

74
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,599
Their target is probably Denji.

75
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,684
We'll deal with it here.

76
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:04,981
Kurose, request for 30 convicts
serving life sentences or worse

77
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:06,733
from the Ministry of Justice.

78
00:10:07,317 --> 00:10:08,235
Tendo.

79
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:12,739
Rent out a nearby shrine
at the highest altitude possible.

80
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:15,742
And…

81
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,120
get me some clean clothes.

82
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,226
Where are we going?

83
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:42,269
God knows.

84
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:44,396
Quiet!

85
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:20,932
Ms. Makima.

86
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:24,728
They're almost there.

87
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,147
Thank you, Tendo.

88
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,608
I'll be there soon.

89
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,341
Hurry up!

90
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,431
I won't be able to fight for a while.

91
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:02,974
Yeah.

92
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,060
He's heavy.

93
00:12:05,644 --> 00:12:06,728
Come help me!

94
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,105
Alright.

95
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:11,733
Grab that side.

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,195
Where am I supposed to hold?

97
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:22,285
Hey!

98
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:23,995
Hey! Just grab it!

99
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,917
What the hell?

100
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,377
Why are you freaking out?

101
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,294
Grab it!

102
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:33,755
Something feels wrong!

103
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,300
What do you mean--

104
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:50,772
Team E!

105
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,566
Have Team C reconfirm Makima's death!

106
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:57,028
This is Team E.

107
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,073
We've been unable to contact Team C for--

108
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,000
That woman…

109
00:13:41,114 --> 00:13:43,116
Why do we need blindfolds too?

110
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:47,871
Ms. Makima reports directly to
the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

111
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:50,373
Ordinary Devil Hunters are
not authorized to know

112
00:13:50,457 --> 00:13:53,001
which Devils she has contracts with.

113
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:02,761
Repeat after me… Shuzou Mishima.

114
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,722
Shuzou Mishima.

115
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,524
Put him in the van!

116
00:14:16,608 --> 00:14:17,442
Y-Yes!

117
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,447
In the van, now!

118
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:24,449
Do you hear me?

119
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,450
Mishima!

120
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,886
Say, Takashi Inoue.

121
00:14:46,012 --> 00:14:47,555
Takashi Inoue.

122
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,667
No!

123
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,835
Hey!

124
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:19,712
Hey!

125
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:22,966
Somebody help me!

126
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:44,487
It stopped.

127
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:57,584
You can remove those now.

128
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,097
I've finished what I can do from here.

129
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,766
I'm returning to Tokyo.

130
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:21,149
This ridiculous power…
It's probably Makima.

131
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:24,736
Let's escape while we still can.

132
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,154
Damn it!

133
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:28,364
Isn't she dead?

134
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,365
You two…

135
00:17:13,493 --> 00:17:15,578
are the shooters, right?

136
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:19,582
Snake. Tail.

137
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,591
What is she, a monkey?

138
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,407
Damn it!

139
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,117
Die inside the van!

140
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,288
Sorry about trying to kill you last time.

141
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:53,176
Why am I still saying that?

142
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:55,553
What am I doing?

143
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:19,619
No. I got too high…

144
00:19:36,177 --> 00:19:38,012
He protected me…

145
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,724
It… It's my fault…

146
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,478
For me, he…

147
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,070
I can't take it anymore…

148
00:19:54,153 --> 00:19:56,531
This job is driving me crazy…

149
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,912
When I see Ms. Himeno,
I'll tell her I'm quitting…

150
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:21,097
Madoka, glad to see you're alive.

151
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,307
How many in the Special Division survived?

152
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:28,521
Special Divisions 1, 2, 3, and 4
all came under gunfire.

153
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:31,691
Almost all the humans died.

154
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,778
A shooting specifically targeting
the Special Division…

155
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:38,364
The Gun Devil is very likely involved.

156
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,659
I have an order from the superiors.

157
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,203
Due to the shortage of personnel,

158
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:47,832
all four Special Divisions
will merge into one.

159
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,835
Tokyo Special Division 4

160
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,421
will be under your command from now on.

161
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,973
Also, this is for you.

162
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:04,974
What is it?

163
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:06,976
My resignation.

164
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,228
You're quitting?

165
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:12,523
It's getting sinister
in the Special Division.

166
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:15,234
It's either quit or die.

167
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,445
I see.

168
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:29,790
I have one last question for you.

169
00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:35,588
How much of this had you anticipated?

170
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:41,677
I can't discuss Public Safety's
internal affairs with civilians.

171
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:45,306
Thank you for your service, Madoka.

172
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:47,642
I'll pass this on.

173
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,243
Well…

174
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:06,577
Ms. Makima.

175
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:09,497
It's not like we're joining
your Special Division.

176
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:12,750
We're just here as advisors.

177
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,419
We'll be on our way back
to Kyoto in one week.

178
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:19,924
That's a shame.

179
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,844
There are so many
great restaurants in Tokyo.
