1
00:00:11,585 --> 00:00:13,126
It was my stomach.

2
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:16,626
What's your name?

3
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,751
Denji.

4
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,501
I'll tell you this up front.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,876
From now on, you are my dog.

6
00:00:26,543 --> 00:00:28,793
And you can only answer me
with "yes" or "woof."

7
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:31,126
I don't need a disobedient dog.

8
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:33,585
By that you mean…

9
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:36,376
I heard from the Forensics Division

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,126
that useless dogs will get
put down in our sector.

11
00:00:46,585 --> 00:00:48,710
<i>I thought she was gentle.</i>

12
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:51,210
<i>I even liked her pretty much.</i>

13
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:54,210
<i>Who would have known that
she was so terrifying</i>

14
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:56,960
<i>and treats people like animals?</i>

15
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,418
<i>She reminded me that Pochita is dead.</i>

16
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,793
I forgot that
we haven't had breakfast yet.

17
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:14,710
Let's grab something to eat on the road.

18
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,960
Sorry. I don't have money.

19
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:21,543
Pick whatever you want. My treat.

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,960
You can't go out half-naked. Put this on.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,793
Here.

22
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:39,460
<i>Everyone always avoids me
like I'm the plague.</i>

23
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,543
<i>This is the first time that
someone is being nice to me.</i>

24
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:44,460
<i>And she's so pretty.</i>

25
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:49,126
<i>I like her.</i>

26
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:19,668
CHAINSAW MAN

27
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,585
I want udon.

28
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:28,418
Udon and… a frankfurter.

29
00:03:28,501 --> 00:03:29,460
Is that okay?

30
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:32,668
Yes. I'll have a curry udon, please.

31
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:33,751
Right away.

32
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,918
Curry udon sounds nice too…

33
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,626
Denji, are you okay?

34
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,418
Whoa… They smell so nice.

35
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,001
How much is it?

36
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,251
-Please wait…
-Denji.

37
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:49,418
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:52,335
I cut myself with the chainsaw.

39
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:55,668
I might have lost too much blood.

40
00:03:56,668 --> 00:03:59,085
How did your body become like this?

41
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:02,835
The Devil I kept with me became my heart.

42
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:05,585
<i>Unbelievable, isn't it?</i>

43
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,751
<i>I don't want to believe either…</i>

44
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:11,001
that Pochita died for me.

45
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:20,335
This is an extremely rare case.

46
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:23,668
They don't even have a name for it.

47
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,876
I believe what you said.

48
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,835
I have an acute sense of smell.

49
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:34,585
That's why I know…

50
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:38,501
that your friend lives inside you.

51
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,043
I don't mean it in a romantic way.

52
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:45,126
Your body has a mixed smell
of a human and a Devil.

53
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,793
Really? That's great.

54
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:50,876
That's so great…

55
00:04:58,626 --> 00:04:59,626
Udon.

56
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:02,418
Udon.

57
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:10,918
Can I start eating now?

58
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:11,835
Sure.

59
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:13,835
Are you okay?

60
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,168
Can you eat by yourself?

61
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,251
I can…

62
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:19,251
I can't.

63
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,835
Here. Say "ah."

64
00:05:24,835 --> 00:05:25,668
Is it good?

65
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:26,668
Woof.

66
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:30,126
Even when the noodles are already soggy?

67
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,918
You really are as vigorous

68
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,751
as a dog.

69
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:37,918
Can I ask…

70
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:40,001
What's your name?

71
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:42,418
Makima.

72
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,668
Ms. Makima. What…

73
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:47,418
What's your type of guy?

74
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,835
Someone like Denji.

75
00:05:57,668 --> 00:05:58,835
Denji…

76
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:03,501
Isn't that me?

77
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,126
<i>What's your type of guy?</i>

78
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,001
<i>Someone like Denji.</i>

79
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:20,335
Me too.

80
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,210
I like Ms. Makima.

81
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,251
Denji, over here.

82
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:31,335
This is the Tokyo HQ
of Public Safety Devil Hunters.

83
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:41,126
We have over a thousand Devil Hunters
in Tokyo, including private ones.

84
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,210
But here in the Public Safety Sector,

85
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:45,626
you get paid holidays and benefits.

86
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:51,543
<i>Ms. Makima said she likes me…</i>

87
00:06:52,043 --> 00:06:56,293
<i>Which means we'll gradually become lovers
after working together.</i>

88
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>Which means…</i>

89
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,793
<i>I can do that with her.</i>

90
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:05,460
<i>Yes. I want to do it with her.</i>

91
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,293
Denji.

92
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:10,960
Yes.

93
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:14,460
We wear uniforms here. This is yours.

94
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:17,460
I'll introduce you to your colleagues
after you change into it.

95
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,543
His name is Aki Hayakawa.

96
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:30,251
He has worked here for three years.

97
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,126
You can go with him today.

98
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:36,876
I'm not working with you?

99
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,001
How is that possible?

100
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:41,918
Ms. Makima's rank is
so much higher than yours.

101
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,001
We're going to patrol.

102
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,751
No! Ms. Makima!

103
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,210
Stand up.

104
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:51,126
No. I want to work with Ms. Makima.

105
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,960
You can work with me

106
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,876
if you are doing a good job.

107
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,751
So, work hard.

108
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:18,585
Hey, Hayakawa.

109
00:08:19,835 --> 00:08:22,251
Does Ms. Makima have a man?

110
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:27,168
I'm asking you.

111
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:29,626
Hey.

112
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:31,876
Come here.

113
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:59,210
You should quit.

114
00:09:00,335 --> 00:09:02,501
I'll beat you up if you show up tomorrow.

115
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,460
Why?

116
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:08,210
Didn't you feel my kindness?

117
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,460
Those who don't take their work seriously
only end up dead.

118
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,251
Even my colleagues.

119
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,876
Those people who became
Devil Hunters for the paycheck

120
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,793
were all killed by the Devils.

121
00:09:18,918 --> 00:09:22,751
Only people who have faith get to survive.

122
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:25,085
You…

123
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:28,335
You came to the sector
for Ms. Makima, right?

124
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,251
Bingo.

125
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,251
Then it's right to beat you.

126
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:40,251
I'll tell Ms. Makima

127
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,460
that you were scared away by the Devils.

128
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,001
You are so gentle with me, Hayakawa.

129
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:03,168
I only

130
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:05,918
aim for the crotch…

131
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:09,501
when I fight with men.

132
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,251
Today is the first time I had udon

133
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:22,293
and frankfurters.

134
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:24,876
The first time being treated
like a person,

135
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
and being fed.

136
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,251
This is like a dream come true.

137
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:35,001
I did come here for inappropriate reasons.

138
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,085
But I'm willing to die

139
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,876
as long as I can keep living like this.

140
00:10:42,418 --> 00:10:44,335
I take that back.

141
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,043
This is not just my own life after all.

142
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:53,668
A punk like you

143
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:58,793
isn't entitled to like someone like her.

144
00:10:58,876 --> 00:10:59,835
What?

145
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:01,085
Crap.

146
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:04,001
It's just because
you like her too, isn't it?

147
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,751
You bastard… really…

148
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:17,293
You only aim for the crotch…

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,210
Oh no.

150
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,835
Hayakawa was attacked in the crotch
by a Testicle Devil.

151
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:33,585
Not true. He's lying.

152
00:11:34,835 --> 00:11:37,418
How is it? Do you get along?

153
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,710
-Impossible.
-He's scum.

154
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:43,126
Great. You get along perfectly.

155
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,960
Denji will join Hayakawa's squad.

156
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,210
Squad?

157
00:11:48,293 --> 00:11:50,210
This punk?

158
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,126
I have enough problems
in the squad already.

159
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,751
If there's one more…

160
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:58,460
I already said when we built the squad

161
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:02,376
that we'll be trying
an unprecedented experimental system.

162
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:07,460
Who is this guy?

163
00:12:07,543 --> 00:12:09,710
Denji is a human,

164
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,668
but he can transform into a Devil.

165
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,668
Awesome. Isn't it?

166
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:15,543
Really?

167
00:12:15,626 --> 00:12:19,710
I've only heard of such rumors…

168
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:22,085
Denji is special.

169
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,793
So we treat him in a special way.

170
00:12:27,418 --> 00:12:31,376
If he leaves the Public Safety Sector
or breaks any rules,

171
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,293
he'll be dealt with as a Devil.

172
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,918
What… does that mean?

173
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:42,835
It means you have to work with us
for the rest of your life.

174
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,835
You'll live with me now for supervision.

175
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,626
She said that I have the right
to kill you if you try to escape.

176
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,585
Hey, is Ms. Makima an evil person?

177
00:13:04,168 --> 00:13:06,710
If you think so, you'd better give up now.

178
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,793
If you are really a Devil,

179
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,710
you should be grateful
that you're still alive.

180
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:13,126
We are Devil Hunters.

181
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,043
Is she a good person?

182
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,626
Of course.

183
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,710
She saved my life.

184
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:32,835
Ms. Makima.

185
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,918
I want to hug her again.

186
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,001
What?

187
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,085
Strawberry jam. Plum jam. Marmalade.

188
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:46,793
Butter, honey, and…

189
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,168
Let's add some cinnamon.

190
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:53,085
The best toast, done.

191
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,210
It's delicious.

192
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:00,460
It's the best.

193
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:03,126
Wow…

194
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,876
Wow…

195
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,210
Wow…

196
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:11,626
You're taking too long.

197
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:15,501
Don't fall asleep in the toilet.

198
00:14:26,418 --> 00:14:28,835
<i>A Fiend was found in an apartment
in east Nerima City.</i>

199
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,585
<i>Evacuation finished. The scene is blocked.</i>

200
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:37,543
The target stays in a room
on the second floor.

201
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,668
We'll leave it to you now, Devil Hunters.

202
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:40,585
Mr. Hayakawa.

203
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,585
Is he a newbie?

204
00:14:47,168 --> 00:14:49,085
Hey. What's a Fiend?

205
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:52,835
What? You never went to school?

206
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,585
Nope, I really haven't.

207
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:58,876
A Devil who took a human corpse.

208
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,043
That's a Fiend.

209
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,293
Oh, so I'm a Fiend?

210
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,376
No.

211
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,085
A Fiend has a particular head shape.

212
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:11,585
You'll see.

213
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,626
A Fiend acts like a Devil.

214
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,043
You take care of this one.

215
00:15:23,626 --> 00:15:25,668
Transform. Show me your power.

216
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:28,418
So I can see if you're useful.

217
00:15:29,168 --> 00:15:30,418
Don't look at me.

218
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:33,418
Kill them all…

219
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:35,418
Those Devil Hunters!

220
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:47,126
Hey. Why didn't you use the Devil's power?

221
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,376
Because…

222
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,293
If I kill Devils with that power,

223
00:15:52,376 --> 00:15:53,876
it seems to be very painful for them.

224
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,043
So…

225
00:15:56,543 --> 00:16:00,126
I could've ended up as
a Fiend just like this one.

226
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,501
I want to make it quicker for them.

227
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,585
Listen. Remember this.

228
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,960
A Fiend is also a Devil.

229
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:13,001
You don't feel sorry for them
as a Devil Hunter.

230
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:17,251
My whole family was killed
by a Devil right in front of me.

231
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:21,043
I've had a couple of drinks
with those cops downstairs.

232
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:24,751
They are risking their lives
just to protect their families.

233
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,210
Everyone takes this seriously, except you.

234
00:16:28,293 --> 00:16:31,751
Personally, I want to make it
as painful as possible for Devils.

235
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,001
Are you here to get along with the Devils?

236
00:16:37,918 --> 00:16:40,501
I'd be happy if a Devil
wants to be my friend.

237
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,543
Because I have no friends…

238
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,543
I'll remember what you said.

239
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,501
He got angry.

240
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:05,001
I just didn't want these magazines
to be ruined by blood.

241
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:09,501
The chainsaw would turn
this whole place into a slaughterhouse.

242
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:12,001
I made it a quick death for you.

243
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:13,543
You can return the favor with these.

244
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,001
Good. I like this one.

245
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:24,293
Let me see your dreams, Denji.

246
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,543
I'm working hard here, Pochita.

247
00:17:28,126 --> 00:17:31,293
I'm living my dream
just like the contract says.

248
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,043
I'll remember what you said.

249
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,460
My dream has come true.

250
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:39,793
But he's still chasing his.

251
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,376
<i>To have a bath every day.</i>

252
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,126
<i>To eat good food.</i>

253
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,418
<i>To have beautiful women around.</i>

254
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,835
<i>What else could I ask for?</i>

255
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:53,418
<i>But I feel like there's something missing.</i>

256
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:57,001
<i>What's the goal that I'll be chasing?</i>

257
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,835
<i>That guy must want revenge.</i>

258
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,668
<i>They want to protect their families.</i>

259
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,668
<i>Does Ms. Makima have a goal?</i>

260
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,001
<i>Ms. Makima…</i>

261
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,668
<i>I want to touch her breasts.</i>

262
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,710
<i>I gave up before
because it seemed impossible.</i>

263
00:18:23,793 --> 00:18:26,960
<i>But now, I have a job.
Maybe there's a chance.</i>

264
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,460
<i>It's too difficult to
straight up hug a woman.</i>

265
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:32,543
<i>But if it's just breasts…</i>

266
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:36,918
<i>I can probably do it
if I have enough will and action.</i>

267
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,710
Everyone takes this seriously, except you.

268
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,418
<i>Is that so?</i>

269
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,960
<i>I found something to take seriously.</i>

270
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:47,126
<i>My goal</i>

271
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,210
<i>is to touch…</i>

272
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,710
breasts!

273
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,335
Breasts?

274
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,751
Hey. Listen carefully, idiot.

275
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,085
To what?

276
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:58,585
You'll have a teammate starting today.

277
00:18:59,168 --> 00:19:00,210
Teammate?

278
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:03,210
As a safety measure, you go in pairs

279
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:07,543
for regional missions or patrols.

280
00:19:08,543 --> 00:19:10,793
It's about time. She's here.

281
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:15,210
Be careful. She's a Fiend.

282
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:19,210
Bow before me, human!

283
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,210
My name is Power!

284
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,085
Are you my teammate?

285
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:25,210
Power?

286
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:26,543
Your name is Power?

287
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:27,710
You're a Fiend?

288
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,251
Can a Fiend be a Devil Hunter?

289
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:36,876
Never mind. Nice to meet you.

290
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,460
Fiends and Devils are indeed
targets of expulsion.

291
00:19:41,543 --> 00:19:44,043
But Power is very rational.

292
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:46,210
So I let her join Hayakawa's squad.

293
00:19:46,793 --> 00:19:48,335
I've said this before.

294
00:19:48,418 --> 00:19:51,585
Tokyo Special Division 4
is an experimental division.

295
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,793
If there are no results,

296
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,043
our superiors might close
the division immediately.

297
00:19:57,543 --> 00:20:00,210
You know what'll happen to you by then,

298
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:01,543
right?

299
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:10,460
<i>Power's horns on her head are conspicuous,</i>

300
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,710
<i>so you should go to less populated areas.</i>

301
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:27,335
Humans! Let me kill something.

302
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:29,543
I'm craving blood.

303
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:36,085
<i>I can tolerate some hits and bites
since she's pretty.</i>

304
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:40,585
<i>The problem is how to get to her breasts.</i>

305
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:49,085
<i>If you meet private Devil Hunters
or are questioned by the police…</i>

306
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,335
…just say you are
from Tokyo Special Division 4.

307
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,335
<i>Then show them your papers,</i>

308
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:56,085
<i>and they'll reluctantly walk away.</i>

309
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,293
There's no Devil at all.

310
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:03,960
Probably because I'm here.

311
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:08,543
I was a very scary Devil
before becoming a Fiend.

312
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,293
Those inferior Devils would run away
once they catch my smell.

313
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:13,251
What?

314
00:21:13,335 --> 00:21:14,918
So we go back with our hands empty?

315
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:19,793
Go to Hayakawa if you have any questions.

316
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,543
It was his decision for you to team up.

317
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:24,126
<i>Bastard.</i>

318
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,918
<i>He set me up.</i>

319
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,418
<i>He teamed me up with Power
so I have no chance to prove my ability.</i>

320
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,418
He wants to make me quit.

321
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,251
The smell of blood.

322
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:41,001
Where are you going?

323
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,293
Come on!

324
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,751
Let's fight!

325
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:49,835
She's running so fast.

326
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:53,585
We've blocked the scene
and evacuated citizens.

327
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:56,460
It's a Sea Cucumber Devil.

328
00:21:56,543 --> 00:21:58,876
Please send backup to Nerima Station.

329
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,585
You don't know what a sea cucumber is?

330
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:05,293
No, I mean…

331
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,793
Sea cu…

332
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:13,543
