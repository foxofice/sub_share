1
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,850
It is 1014 A.D.

2
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,490
York is under the control
of the Danish Vikings led by King Sweyn.

3
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,530
The town is a major center
for supplying slaves to much of Europe.

4
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,540
In this location, the Vikings
are the main traders of slaves.

5
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,840
I understand how you feel, chief.

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,470
But we're not rich enough to liberate
the slaves even if we feel sorry for them.

7
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,720
It's been 11 years.

8
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,890
Haven't we spent enough time here?

9
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,690
If Thors hadn't saved me back then,
I wouldn't have made it out alive.

10
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,280
I still owe him that debt.

11
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,120
Hurry! Ready everything!

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
What's going on?

13
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,830
Hey, you!

14
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,500
Get that hunk of junk off the pier!

15
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,920
Hurry up! The lead ship is almost here!

16
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,930
Heave-ho!

17
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,550
Get out of here!

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,680
The royal ships are lining up
to pull into the wharf!

19
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,890
Yeah! We got it!

20
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,560
Heave-ho!

21
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,730
So this is York?

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,570
It's a large town.

23
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,240
Yes.

24
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,030
It's an old town
that goes back to Roman times.

25
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,990
People and cargo from both
Scandinavia and England gather here.

26
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,170
The king likely intends to use it
as the base for his new dynasty.

27
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,090
It is a good choice.

28
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,050
I would do the same.

29
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,430
What are these nobles doing here?

30
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,680
They're such a pain in the ass.

31
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,020
Hey, chief. Get the stern, will you?

32
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,810
Huh?

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,440
That man.

34
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,320
There's no mistaking him.

35
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,780
I could never forget that face!

36
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,660
Askeladd!

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,250
The pirate who killed Thors!

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,210
Don't push!

39
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,210
Whose procession is this?

40
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,710
So what will we do?

41
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,170
The king will provoke a fight
at tomorrow's banquet.

42
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,220
You're right. We'll need a plan.

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,180
It's clear that we'll be disadvantaged
at tomorrow's royal council meeting.

44
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,270
Two separate territories may be given
to you and Thorkell, thus separating you.

45
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,810
That will be both
a reward and a command from the king.

46
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,570
If you refuse the offer,
it could be seen as an act of sedition.

47
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,150
It all depends on the whim of the king.

48
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,830
It will be a problem
if Thorkell is stolen from us.

49
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,240
Indeed. A big problem.

50
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,910
So am I supposed to sit and wait?

51
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,000
What do you think about

52
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,800
exposing everything
to all these people right here and now?

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
Expose what?

54
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,390
Which one is the prince?

55
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,390
Isn't that him?

56
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,470
Prince Canute…

57
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,230
by this I mean
that right here and now,

58
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,270
you will be assassinated.

59
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,450
He has been shot!

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,540
The prince has been shot!

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,120
Damn it! Where did it come from?

62
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,460
The northern bank! Search the area!

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,790
What? From this direction?

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,210
Seriously?

65
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,720
That was an easy job.

66
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,560
I think something has gone wrong.

67
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,360
We shouldn't get involved.

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,860
Hey, chief! Where are you going?

69
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,980
It's him! He's there!

70
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,620
What happened to you?

71
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,790
Are you all right?

72
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,160
You're bleeding.

73
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,140
What a waste of my time.

74
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,080
Hold it right there, you bastards!

75
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,540
What's going on down there?

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,540
You must be the rogues
behind the assassination!

77
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,670
It was him, not me.
He even has a deadly weapon.

78
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
What is this?

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,590
Is this a bow?

80
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,220
That's the deadly weapon?

81
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,840
Are you his accomplice?

82
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,340
No, I…

83
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,970
Don't think
you can blame him and get away!

84
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,390
You're pinning it on your pal
so you can save your own hide.

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,940
I said it wasn't me.

86
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,400
Lies! I can tell it by your eyes.

87
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,150
Look at those dull, dead eyes!

88
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,030
No matter what you say
you look like a villain!

89
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,280
You intend to fight back?

90
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,990
Wait a minute!

91
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,120
He's a knife-thrower,

92
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,580
short and young.

93
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,630
Is it possible that you are

94
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,550
Thorfinn Karlsefni?

95
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,630
Thorfinn?

96
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,420
Karlsefni?

97
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,550
Who is that?

98
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,390
Idiot! Don't you know?

99
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:43,310
He's the man who beat Thorkell the Tall
with two knives in a duel!

100
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,980
Really? Unbelievable.

101
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,100
This can't be good.

102
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,230
This guy's a servant of the prince.

103
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,150
Really?

104
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,230
Excuse me.

105
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,650
Are you…

106
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,700
Do you, perchance,

107
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,910
come from Iceland?

108
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,620
Your name

109
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,080
is Thorfinn, son of Thors.

110
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,170
You are

111
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,500
old man Leif?

112
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,010
You're alive!

113
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,930
Thank the Gods!

114
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,350
I am so overjoyed!

115
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,690
Out of the way!

116
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,190
Don't shake him, idiot!

117
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,190
-Where was he hit?
-The chest!

118
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,940
Your Highness, stay with us!

119
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,570
Your Highness,
I'm going to cut your clothes.

120
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,950
What the…?

121
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,380
I suspected the rumors were true, but…

122
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,090
The prince is a woman after all!

123
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,890
-What a revelation!
-This can't be!

124
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,800
You fools.

125
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,430
I'm right here.

126
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,520
Of course, it wasn't true.

127
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,860
Why was a woman used?

128
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,650
We couldn't find a male slave
who looked like you on such short notice.

129
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Can she be saved?

130
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,200
There's little chance.

131
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,910
It is a mortal wound.

132
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,870
And if the arrow was poisoned,
then she could already be…

133
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,790
Forgive me for this.

134
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,930
Tend to her and do everything
in your power to save her.

135
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,260
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,270
It seems taking precautions
was a wise decision, Your Highness.

137
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,150
Doubtless you have several enemies
hiding here in the town of York.

138
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
I understand.

139
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,700
You're seeking revenge.

140
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,540
Yes.

141
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,250
The time will come
when I will kill that bastard

142
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,710
with my father's dagger.

143
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,760
He looks exhausted.

144
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,010
For a young boy like him
to grow up on the battlefield,

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,060
means he's undoubtedly been through hell.

146
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,020
But I cannot give up.

147
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,270
To save this child,
I must put the past 11 years behind me

148
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,360
Leif.

149
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,150
How is Vinland?

150
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,900
How is it there now?

151
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,320
My father wanted to go there.

152
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,330
I sometimes see it in my dreams.

153
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,330
Have they even established a village?

154
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,710
Why not ask about
the mother and sister you left behind?

155
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,960
Ever since you disappeared,
Helga's health has grown worse.

156
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,010
Go see her, Thorfinn.

157
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,760
It would be medicine for Helga.

158
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,430
I'm asking you about Vinland!

159
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,060
Why speak of things
I did not ask about?

160
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,520
Hey.

161
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,610
Hey, stop. Where are you going? Thorfinn!

162
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,610
Go back home, Thorfinn.

163
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,530
Stop this!

164
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,320
Let's go home together!

165
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Enough?

166
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,200
What the hell do you know?

167
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,580
What the hell do you know about me
after what happened that day?

168
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,000
Huh?

169
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,630
As long as Askeladd lives,
eats, and shits, it's not enough!

170
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,890
It's not enough!

171
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,600
What a tragic sight.

172
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,940
What has that cheerful boy become?

173
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,200
I will wait here
until you change your mind.

174
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,700
Thorfinn!

175
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,870
Come back home!

176
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,500
I brought you some booze.

177
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,380
Oh, thank you.

178
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,010
This is quite the room, Bjorn.

179
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,260
I'm jealous.

180
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,510
For risking my life,
this room is much too small.

181
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,100
That reminds me,

182
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,770
Atli wanted to tell you
that he greatly regrets what he did.

183
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,650
It's kill or be killed on the battlefield.
There are no hard feelings.

184
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,870
The only one
clutching onto a grudge is Thorfinn.

185
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,410
I'm fine. You can go.
Isn't it time for you to start scheming?

186
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,500
Yeah. I'll see you later.

187
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,130
Askeladd.

188
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,800
How

189
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,430
is your leg healing?

190
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,190
It took its share of arrows.

191
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,940
But it's fine.

192
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,110
It won't hinder me from wielding a sword.

193
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,860
I see.

194
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,700
Then, see you tomorrow.

195
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,660
All right.

196
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,870
Tomorrow.

197
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,380
We were outmaneuvered.

198
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,130
Floki.

199
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,130
Yes.

200
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,960
I offer my deepest apologies.

201
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,680
Askeladd, right?

202
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,430
He's proven capable.

203
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,730
He has cast a shadow over the whole town.

204
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,480
The prince was killed?

205
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,780
No, it was a double.

206
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,120
How horrible. No one
will sleep soundly tonight.

207
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,660
But I just don't get it.

208
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,380
What reason would an assassin
have for targeting the prince?

209
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,300
Well, he is nobility.
Naturally, his life would be in danger.

210
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,220
Yes, but we all know
that King Sweyn is here as well.

211
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,550
Why wasn't he targeted?

212
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,850
You have a point there.

213
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,810
Besides, he has two potential successors.

214
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,650
If someone specifically targeted
the second son, then that means…

215
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,650
You guys.

216
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,190
I heard something interesting
about that very thing.

217
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,620
I mean, it's really just
an unfounded rumor, but…

218
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,210
Something that's just a rumor.
That should be enough.

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,460
It should be something unprovable
and it should give the king leeway.

220
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,090
So you hired the assassin and planned
everything from start to finish.

221
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,550
Not a bad performance, right?

222
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,850
But it's not enough
to merely spread a rumor.

223
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:28,360
For such a production, there needs
to be some truth for the rumor to spread.

224
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,070
Everyone knows
about the dispute over the succession.

225
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,740
To this fact, I added
an assassination attempt and a rumor.

226
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,990
Now then, gentlemen,

227
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,490
let's see how this affects
tomorrow's royal council.

228
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,290
I see.

229
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,830
He can no longer give orders
that would be unfavorable to me.

230
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,540
Precisely.

231
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,130
If the king tries to steal Thorkell away
or send you to the battlefield,

232
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,130
it will only support the rumors.

233
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,800
The king needs
the good favor of his subjects.

234
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,350
He cannot risk damaging
his reputation with the army…

235
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,890
especially if he's accused
of targeting his own son.

236
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,070
You truly are a cunning man.

237
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,070
Where did you learn all this?

238
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,570
Using brute force
isn't the only way to fight.

239
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,490
That's a good lesson.

240
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,750
For the time being,
the king won't be able to touch me.

241
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,670
It's a good plan to buy us time.

242
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,090
But from now on, I forbid you
to use a substitute in my place.

243
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,630
Understood.

244
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,630
I am deeply sorry.

245
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,930
You've truly impressed me, Askeladd!

246
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,770
It's like having
an army of 10,000 supporters.

247
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,520
Much obliged.

248
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,270
Well, now that our discussion is over,
I must attend to another matter.

249
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,030
Yes indeed! This is all very reassuring!

250
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,740
Your Highness.

251
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,200
You cannot trust Gunnar.

252
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,080
He's likely working for King Sweyn.

253
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,420
Why do you think so?

254
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,080
Based on what?

255
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,290
Intuition.

256
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,210
But there's no doubt about it.

257
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,220
Then isn't this bad?
He knows everything now.

258
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,050
It doesn't matter.

259
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,510
I only said what I wanted him to hear.

260
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,180
If Gunnar's an enemy,
then he'll relay the information tonight.

261
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,390
I have Thorfinn tailing him to confirm it.

262
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,900
What do we do if Gunnar is a spy?

263
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,650
Kill him?

264
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,320
We let him go.

265
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,360
Through him,

266
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,580
we'll let the king know
we don't want a quick, decisive battle.

267
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,000
He'll believe his spy,
and this will set him at ease.

268
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,250
To avoid an impending dispute,
we need to be on the same page.

269
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:00,340
And with that, my plan is complete.

270
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,590
Wow.

271
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,310
This man is really something.

272
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,600
I can't wait to see
the king's reaction tomorrow.

273
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,660
The king's home? Well, that settles it.

274
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,960
They're all obsessed
with deceiving each other.

275
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,960
Is that what a warrior does?

276
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:38,250
There's only one thing left for me to do.

277
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,140
You couldn't have waited until
after the royal council meeting, Thorfinn?

278
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,480
Wouldn't it be better
for you to wait until your arm heals?

279
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,200
Well, it's up to you. I'm fine either way.

280
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,660
I will bear witness.

281
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:14,120
When I tell you to stop, the duel is over.
Do both parties agree?

282
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,170
That's fine.

283
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,000
But please wait a moment, Your Highness.

284
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,470
I have another appointment before this.
He should be here soon.

285
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,480
Sorry, Thorfinn.

286
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,770
This won't take long.

287
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,280
Understood.

288
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,900
Begin.

289
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
Askeladd.

290
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,390
You are strong and clever.

291
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,680
And I respect you…

292
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,730
even though you have loathed me
from the bottom of your heart.

293
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,700
Right, Askeladd?

294
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,450
But it's not just me.

295
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,790
All of our dead comrades.

296
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,540
And even yourself.

297
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,630
Is it not lonely?

298
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,220
Rejecting everyone
and everything the way you do?

299
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,970
I…

300
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,180
wanted to be…

301
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,440
I wanted to be…

302
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,310
to be your friend.

303
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,340
Forgive me!

304
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,930
I missed your heart.

305
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,180
I'll end it quickly!

306
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,550
Askeladd.

307
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,770
I wanted to be your friend.

308
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,690
Yes, Bjorn.

309
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,070
You were…

310
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,240
my one and only

311
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,530
true friend.

312
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,380
Send me off.

313
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,660
Now then.

314
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,450
Sorry to keep you waiting, kid.

315
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,460
Come.

316
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,050
I'll play with you now.

317
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,810
