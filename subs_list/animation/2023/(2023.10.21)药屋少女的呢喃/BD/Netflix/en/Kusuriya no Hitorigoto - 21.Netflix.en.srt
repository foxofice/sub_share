ORIGINAL STORY BY: NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,467
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION,

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,468
{\an8}AND ALL NAMES OF FIGURES
AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

4
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,552
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

5
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,599
What's wrong, Lihaku? Concentrate!

6
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,851
Right. Sorry.

7
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,938
{\an8}You're cleaning?

8
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,690
{\an8}You don't need to do it yourself.

9
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,067
We can ask someone else…

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,114
What if we ask someone,
and they swap out the medicine?

11
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,658
In the court medical office,

12
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,452
there were some physicians
whose salaries were cut

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,456
because they failed to manage
the medicine properly.

14
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,129
You have to clean up
before it gets too humid.

15
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,464
You'll regret it later.

16
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:12,966
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,685
We're almost done.

18
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,647
Sweets are the best for when you're tired!

19
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,151
<i>This guy is super rich, huh?</i>

20
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>You can rarely find sweet potatoes</i>
<i>at this time of year.</i>

21
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,365
<i>And he uses paper for plates</i>
<i>like it's nothing…</i>

22
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,788
-This is some nice paper.
-Can you tell?

23
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:47,000
My family back home organizes
the whole village to make these.

24
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,253
They're purveyors that make paper
for the court!

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,882
-Impressive, huh?
-Yes, that's impressive.

26
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,010
<i>I wonder if he can get me</i>
<i>a friends-only discount.</i>

27
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,761
Back then,

28
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,556
the more paper we made, the richer we got.

29
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,436
We did a lot of exporting
to other countries,

30
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:11,649
so I could get all the sweets I wanted
when I was a kid!

31
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,192
But,

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,196
ever since the previous emperor's mother
forbade cutting down trees,

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,407
it didn't go so well.

34
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>We started using other materials,</i>
<i>so trade started to fail.</i>

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,332
<i>Our family was blamed for this.</i>

36
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>We ran out of money, so</i>
<i>my older sister went to the rear palace.</i>

37
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,422
When even my younger sister offered to go,

38
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,883
I decided to come here instead.

39
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,929
There are never enough eunuchs,
so we got paid more that way.

40
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,807
In the end, I never did see
my older sister.

41
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,937
<i>He's had more struggles than I thought.</i>

42
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,367
Excuse me. I'm here to finish cleaning.

43
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,868
Oh, it's you, miss.

44
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,998
I got a letter from my younger sister.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,252
The court might stop using our paper.

46
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,590
<i>True, this isn't high quality enough</i>
<i>to be used in the court.</i>

47
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,218
<i>Losing the title of court purveyor</i>

48
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,553
<i>could really impact sales.</i>

49
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,222
I wonder why.

50
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:28,309
They worked hard so that
they could make more paper than before.

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:33,147
Did they cut down on some the steps
to be able to make more?

52
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,692
We'd never do something like that!

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,278
We started having cows handle
some of the labor.

54
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,532
We haven't changed materials
or the process at all.

55
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,785
<i>I guess we won't be cleaning today.</i>

56
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>Unlike some low-quality items</i>
<i>you can find in shops,</i>

57
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>there are no impurities,</i>

58
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,920
<i>the fibers are crushed down evenly,</i>
<i>and the thickness is even.</i>

59
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>The problem is the scuffing</i>
<i>on the surface, and…</i>

60
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>the durability!</i>

61
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,637
And what is the process?

62
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,223
It's just regular paper-making.

63
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,809
But we have our own special way
of crushing materials

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,270
and creating the glue…

65
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,439
Oh, this is all I can say.

66
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,275
<i>So even he doesn't overshare</i>
<i>trade secrets.</i>

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>Do you use special water too?</i>

68
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,781
<i>Yes. We draw spring water</i>

69
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,117
<i>so that the glue hardens properly.</i>

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,536
<i>It's to maintain a certain level</i>
<i>of humidity.</i>

71
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
I can't say any more than that.

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>Cow… Spring water…</i>

73
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:38,504
<i>Lightning bolt!</i>

74
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,303
Do you simmer rice-soaked water
to make the glue?

75
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,389
No, we mix flour and water.

76
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,142
Otherwise, it won't harden properly…

77
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,730
Miss, will you forget what I just said?

78
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,814
Certainly.

79
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,276
And where do you keep the cows?

80
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,488
I don't know about those details.

81
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,864
I see.

82
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,992
Here you are.

83
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:09,952
Arrowroot tea?

84
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,125
Miss, you messed up the measurements.

85
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,337
It's stuck to the cup. I can't drink it.

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,047
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,092
I'll tell you how you can drink this
more easily.

88
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,676
Will you follow my steps?

89
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,601
Lick your spoon, and mix.
You repeat that many times.

90
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,728
Isn't this bad manners?

91
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,031
-Hey, the thickness is gone.
-Right?

92
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,202
Arrowroot tea and glue are similar,
don't you think?

93
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,915
They're not dissimilar.
Maybe once you mix in saliva

94
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,584
the glue won't be thick anymore.

95
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,711
You're exactly right.

96
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,756
What are you saying?

97
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,925
<i>This quack is really dense.</i>

98
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,597
Cows have a lot of saliva in their mouths.

99
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:17,186
Maybe you could check
where the cows are drinking water.

100
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,150
I have to write to my sister!

101
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,653
I'll be going now.

102
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,952
I'm back.

103
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,203
Hey, Maomao.

104
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,540
I got a message for you to come
immediately.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,293
Where is the meeting place?

106
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,922
How much does it cost to
buy out a courtesan?

107
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,719
<i>I thought this was about Suirei.</i>

108
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,220
<i>He's truly an incompetent dog.</i>

109
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,222
Listen to this, miss!

110
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,807
I went to the Verdigris House

111
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,894
and heard one of
the Three Princesses is being bought out!

112
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,981
<i>That's why he's worried about</i>
<i>Big Sis Pairin.</i>

113
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,192
There's a huge range in prices.

114
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,776
What's the highest price?

115
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,320
All right, I'll tell you.

116
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,949
Market price can change,
so it's only a general estimate.

117
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,409
I want a straightforward answer.

118
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,745
How much?

119
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,331
<i>It's hard to say.</i>

120
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,460
<i>Prices are decided by how much</i>
<i>the courtesan would make at the brothel</i>

121
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,005
<i>if she weren't bought out,</i>
<i>with some extra money added.</i>

122
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,508
<i>Sometimes, they will even</i>
<i>double the price.</i>

123
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,929
Miss…

124
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,268
If Big Sis Pairin were to be bought out,
there are two candidates

125
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
who are old regulars.

126
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
Two?

127
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,235
<i>The first is an Old Master</i>
<i>of a merchant family.</i>

128
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:51,322
<i>He's a good-natured old man who continued</i>
<i>to come even when we were struggling.</i>

129
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,785
<i>Another is a high-ranking official</i>
<i>who is her regular.</i>

130
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,954
<i>He's still young, in his early thirties.</i>

131
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,749
<i>Apparently, they're very compatible</i>
<i>in bed,</i>

132
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>but a point of concern is how tired</i>
<i>he looks the next day.</i>

133
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,048
Considering the kind of life
she'd live after being bought out,

134
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,508
neither is perfect.

135
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,594
Tired? What do you mean?

136
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,932
<i>Big Sis Pairin is known</i>
<i>for not only being good at dance,</i>

137
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,977
<i>but for always winning in bed.</i>

138
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,814
<i>When she feels unfulfilled, she will</i>
<i>try to seduce anybody and everybody.</i>

139
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,107
<i>She's a nymphomaniac.</i>

140
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,568
No!

141
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,485
But…

142
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,321
But?

143
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,992
<i>The people who took care of me</i>

144
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,286
<i>at the Verdigris House</i>
<i>until Old Man took me in</i>

145
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,955
<i>were Grams and the Three Princesses.</i>

146
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>And Big Sis Pairin,</i>

147
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,961
<i>who had the special condition of being</i>
<i>able to breastfeed</i>

148
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:49,046
<i>despite never having her own children,</i>

149
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,799
<i>is the closest thing I have to a mother.</i>

150
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:56,053
<i>I'm not sure what Big Sis thinks of this,</i>

151
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,308
<i>but when I think back to those days,</i>
<i>I feel a wasted potential.</i>

152
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,437
<i>She's a woman with a lot of lust,</i>

153
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,773
<i>but she has just as much</i>
<i>maternal instinct.</i>

154
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
But… what?

155
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:18,743
<i>Sir Lihaku loves Big Sis</i>
<i>while fully understanding what her job is.</i>

156
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,163
<i>He is an incompetent dog,</i>
<i>but he's an earnest man,</i>

157
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,457
<i>and he's a lovable idiot</i>

158
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,667
<i>who's working to climb the ranks</i>
<i>for a woman.</i>

159
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,545
<i>And, he has a lot of stamina.</i>

160
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,345
<i>He's not a bad candidate to buy her out.</i>

161
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,388
Sir Lihaku.

162
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,183
How much do you get paid as a salary?

163
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,143
How is this relevant?

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,354
About 800 silvers?

165
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,315
-Hey, now.
-1,200 silvers, then?

166
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,486
<i>About 1,000 silvers a year, it looks like.</i>

167
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,196
-It's not enough?
-Not at all.

168
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,199
You'd want at least 10,000 upfront.

169
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,202
-Ten thousand?
-Huh?

170
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,829
A cheap courtesan would be 400,

171
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,457
but one of the Three Princesses
of the Verdigris House

172
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,210
would be at least 10,000 silvers.

173
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,837
Ten thousand…

174
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,173
Hey.

175
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,425
If I were to scrounge up 10,000,

176
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,761
would I be able to buy her out?

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:23,391
You mean, would you get ruthlessly
rejected by Big Sis?

178
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,480
It can't be helped.

179
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:34,402
Sir Lihaku, can you take off your clothes?

180
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,446
I won't get rejected
if I take my clothes off?

181
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,323
The only thing I'm certain of

182
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,410
is the kind of body
Big Sis Pairin prefers.

183
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,750
And your bottoms too.

184
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,920
-Do I have to?
-You have to.

185
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,215
Once you strip, raise both hands
to your shoulders

186
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,384
and make a fist, please.

187
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,220
Like this?

188
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,224
<i>Big Sis has an appetite</i>
<i>and would eat anything,</i>

189
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,227
<i>but she does have personal taste.</i>

190
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,438
<i>This is impressive.</i>

191
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,066
Now, lower your arms and make a fist.

192
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,068
Like this?

193
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,531
<i>He's a military man, so he's well-trained.</i>

194
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,576
<i>His muscles are impressive.</i>

195
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,412
<i>Maybe it could work.</i>

196
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,330
Up next…

197
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,292
Please take off your last article
of clothing!

198
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,508
You two, what are you doing?

199
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,968
How do you do,

200
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,304
Sir Jinshi?

201
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,810
What were you doing?

202
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,813
<i>Beautiful people are scary</i>
<i>when they get mad.</i>

203
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:56,150
I don't know what to tell you.

204
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:59,195
I was called upon, and was
providing advice about something.

205
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:02,156
Why was that man making that pose?

206
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,949
It's nothing suspicious.

207
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,868
I was just studying it closely.

208
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,161
<i>What?</i>

209
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:11,373
You were studying it closely?

210
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,792
Yes, I was just looking.

211
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,421
-For what purpose?
-Why do you ask?

212
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,007
To determine
if he has a favorable body type,

213
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,301
the easiest way is to
look at the real thing.

214
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,470
A favorable body type?

215
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,971
Yes.

216
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:29,058
Appearances are only a part
of what makes a person,

217
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,477
but the more favorable, the better.

218
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,606
<i>I was going to check</i>
<i>his most important area</i>

219
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,568
<i>to determine how to convince Big Sis…</i>

220
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:47,201
And how was his appearance?

221
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,829
He had a well-balanced body.

222
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,875
He looked to be a diligent man
who trains without rest every day,

223
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,921
and I'm sure he's one
of the most skilled soldiers as well.

224
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,007
You can see what kind of person someone is

225
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,717
just by looking at their body?

226
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,722
Lifestyle habits are visible
in someone's body.

227
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,558
If you're an apothecary,

228
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,977
clients often don't share their lives
with you.

229
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,229
It's an important skill.

230
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,316
So you could figure me out
by looking at my body?

231
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,276
What?

232
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,194
<i>Could it be,</i>

233
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,572
<i>he's jealous of Sir Lihaku?</i>

234
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,490
<i>What a proud man.</i>

235
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,579
<i>He wants to show off</i>
<i>and say he's more beautiful!</i>

236
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>I know he has a beautiful body.</i>

237
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,126
<i>It was more muscular than I expected.</i>

238
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,378
<i>But…</i>

239
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:43,841
There's no point in me
looking at your body.

240
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:50,472
Unfortunately, I don't think you'd
pair well with my Big Sister.

241
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,682
What?

242
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,312
<i>What am I doing?</i>

243
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,939
<i>Pairin might be getting</i>
<i>bought out at this very moment!</i>

244
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,609
<i>But I have no power to do anything</i>

245
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,903
<i>right now!</i>

246
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,741
Pairin…

247
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,207
<i>What's going on?</i>

248
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,461
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>
<i>his name is Jinshi.</i>

249
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,547
<i>Some rumor him to be the Emperor's lover.</i>

250
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,051
Thanks for entertaining my maid
the other day.

251
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,346
It was nothing.

252
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,305
I heard that

253
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,016
you're in love with someone right now.

254
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,100
What?

255
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,979
<i>Did that girl tell him?</i>

256
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,483
<i>Is that why he's smiling so much at me?</i>

257
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,194
<i>He's already been called</i>

258
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,696
<i>the most beautiful person in the country</i>
<i>at his young age.</i>

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,366
<i>If he's a lover for royalty,</i>

260
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,410
<i>it must sound silly to him</i>
<i>to buy out a courtesan.</i>

261
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,330
<i>It's fine if he makes fun of me.</i>

262
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,793
<i>But if he's making fun of Pairin,</i>
<i>then I won't keep quiet.</i>

263
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>If he means to insult her…</i>

264
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,047
Twenty thousand.

265
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,927
If I offered to loan you money
to buy her out, would you accept?

266
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,933
What do you mean by that?

267
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,226
I mean exactly what I said.

268
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,775
I'm very grateful for your offer,

269
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,236
but is this something you can say

270
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,447
to an official who you've never met?

271
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,243
My cat is very suspicious, you see.

272
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,954
But she's helping you with your problem,

273
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,208
and she's assessing
whether you're a worthy partner

274
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,127
for her sister.

275
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,548
So you're saying,
if your cautious cat trusts me,

276
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,175
you know I'm a principled person…

277
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,889
<i>Did I say something to upset him?</i>

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,477
I heard about you from your acquaintances.

279
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,564
You're the son of a regional official,

280
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,234
but I'm sure you struggled with
becoming a soldier in the capital.

281
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,697
I heard that an observant soldier
saw your potential, and appointed you

282
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,741
to lead your squad.

283
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,492
Yes, sir.

284
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,537
<i>He saw through the official explanation,</i>

285
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,330
<i>which is that the squad leader quit.</i>

286
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,293
I'm sure it's normal to want to
befriend a talented official

287
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,878
with a lot of potential.

288
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,799
<i>Even so, 20,000 silvers</i>
<i>is too high a price for the return.</i>

289
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,468
<i>I only really need half,</i>

290
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,637
<i>or even a quarter of the offer amount.</i>

291
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:45,105
I'm honestly very happy
that you see my potential,

292
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,692
and to be frank,
your offer is extremely tempting to me.

293
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,946
Even so, I can't accept your silver.

294
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:57,076
For you, it might just be a courtesan,

295
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,454
but for me, she's the only woman I want.

296
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,332
If I want her as a wife,

297
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,959
but can't buy her out with my own money,

298
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,672
how can I call myself a man?

299
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,555
I see. I'm sorry about that.

300
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,349
-What?
-I might want…

301
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,601
To talk to you at a later date.

302
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,603
Would that be fine?

303
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,397
Yes, sir!

304
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,405
-Sir Jinshi.
-Yeah.

305
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,950
Looks like there's no need to worry.

306
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,413
What the hell was that?

307
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,500
What should I do?

308
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,044
I guess I can start

309
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,549
by showing off what I can do
at the next training session.

310
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,301
Or maybe, I'll ask for more work.

311
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,556
No. All right.

312
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,731
<i>I don't know when I'll see her next,</i>
<i>but I'll write to her.</i>

313
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>I shouldn't just buy her out</i>
<i>without telling her.</i>

314
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,242
<i>I'll ask how she feels.</i>

315
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,754
<i>Maybe she'll respond</i>
<i>with social pleasantries.</i>

316
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,465
<i>I'll just have to believe in them</i>
<i>to work hard every day.</i>

317
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:05,037
I'll just walk the path
I chose for myself!

318
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,626
<i>Grams is saying a whole bunch of things,</i>

319
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,961
<i>but I intend on working for much longer.</i>

320
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,796
<i>I'm still waiting</i>

321
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,467
<i>for some prince to come for me</i>
<i>and take me away.</i>

322
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,887
That's what I thought.

323
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,598
As long as Big Sis Pairin likes him,

324
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,434
he doesn't need to pay 10,000 silvers.

325
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,977
All he needs now is luck.

326
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,524
<i>That man came again to discuss</i>
<i>buying out a courtesan.</i>

327
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,902
<i>I think that's what caused</i>
<i>the misunderstanding.</i>

328
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
<i>"That man…"</i>

329
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,749
Sir Lakan.

330
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
I looked all over for you.

331
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,797
Sir Lakan, the meeting is about to start.

332
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,757
A blue rose.

333
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,260
What is that?
