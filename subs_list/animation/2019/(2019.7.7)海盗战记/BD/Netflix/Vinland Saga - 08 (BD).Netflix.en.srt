1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,770
There, there.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,190
There, there.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,110
Battleships approaching!

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,030
Notify Lord Gorm!

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,740
Wait a minute. Look again.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,410
Those are Askeladd's ships.

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,500
Finally home to the village.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,760
Good God. We've survived another year.

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,420
You've evaded death once again, Bjorn.

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,840
We've completed quite the journey.

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,350
Hey, there's sheep!

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,390
They're still letting them graze?

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,100
They're trying to fatten them up a bit.

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,560
It seems old man Gorm
is as greedy as ever.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,580
Bastards, you did well
once again this year.

16
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,160
Enjoy the winter to the fullest!

17
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,890
That way!

18
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,520
NOVEMBER 1012 A.D.

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,100
VILLAGE OF FEUDAL LORD GORM
JUTLAND PENINSULA

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,980
Look at all that treasure.

21
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,440
I heard they won a great victory
in the land of the Franks.

22
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,230
I'd expect no less from Askeladd!

23
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,700
I heard many died this year.

24
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,610
Really?

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,370
I wonder if he'll recruit new crewmen.

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,080
Damn, I'm excited!

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,790
If I sailed,
it'd have to be on Askeladd's ship!

28
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,790
Idiot.

29
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,830
You'd last three days and die.

30
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,050
Wait a minute. Apologize.

31
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,690
What's with that kid?

32
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,240
-Here we go.
-Yes.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,570
Ready, and…

34
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,160
Askeladd!

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,330
Welcome home!

36
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,790
Hello there, ladies!

37
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,870
Aren't you cute?

38
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,540
Here. I've brought you
some fine accessories.

39
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,130
I want a ring!

40
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,510
Old man Gorm,

41
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,510
the girls here aren't shy,
but it's actually quite nice!

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,390
Stop talking about girls and get serious.

43
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,640
Are you even listening?

44
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:21,520
Listen, each crewman's daily provisions
cost one and a quarter silver coins.

45
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,480
You've got 97 crewmen,

46
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,740
so that's 121 coins.

47
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,700
You're still doing the accounting?

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,570
The price of pigs increased this year.

49
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,410
If you eat pork every day,
it costs even more.

50
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,660
With the extra cost of beer

51
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,210
and the lodging
and firewood expenses added in--

52
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,540
Don't worry, old man.
Our earnings were excellent this year.

53
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,420
Give me and my men
plenty of food and liquor.

54
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,510
I'll pay you.

55
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,050
That's just what I wanted to hear.
I'll give you a drink.

56
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,140
Bring the celebratory wine.

57
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,810
We have that good wine, right? Bring that.

58
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,350
One, two, three…

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,980
Old man, you really like money that much?

60
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,900
Does anyone hate it?

61
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,360
Money is good.
Just looking at it lifts my spirits.

62
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,660
Hordaland! What are you doing?

63
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,960
Hurry up and bring the wine.

64
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,420
Yes.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,050
Dear me. What a troublesome woman.

66
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,510
That slave girl has a strange name.

67
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,970
"Hordaland."

68
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,680
Her name is a region in Norway?

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,060
Yeah. I bought her recently.

70
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,400
Her father was a lord, but her family
was ruined after losing in a war.

71
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,030
The girl was expensive
because of her beauty.

72
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,990
But she's a poor head for work.

73
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,490
Good grief. Being waited on all her life
has made her prideful and useless.

74
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,660
By the way, old man.

75
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,580
Huh?

76
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,620
Would you be a witness for me?

77
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,080
I've got a duel to settle before dinner.

78
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,500
A duel?

79
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,010
By the way,
it's not her fault she's useless.

80
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,640
You're just bad at using her.

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,890
What did you say?

82
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,520
No matter who it is,

83
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,230
you can always use them if you know how.

84
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,980
Hurry!

85
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,940
What's going on?

86
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,530
They said it's a duel!

87
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,280
Come on, kid!

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,650
-Kill him!
-You can do it!

89
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,660
And now, in the name of Odin,

90
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,000
the duel between Thorfinn
and Askeladd will now ensue.

91
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,340
Each may have a weapon of his choosing.

92
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,250
If they fight with honor,

93
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,510
in the case of death, the dead will be
welcomed at the gates of Valhalla.

94
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,300
Seriously?

95
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,720
He was part of Askeladd's crew?

96
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,350
Then I'm certainly worthy
of joining his crew.

97
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,890
Isn't he kind of cute?

98
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,060
What?

99
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,980
Askeladd's much richer and stronger.

100
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,860
Furthermore, the reason for the duel
is for Thorfinn to avenge his father.

101
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,120
Do either of you have any objections?

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
No.

103
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,120
No.

104
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,830
Then begin!

105
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,500
That Thorfinn never hesitates, does he?

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,060
You've… gotten taller.

107
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,310
How old are you now?

108
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,150
Back then, you were only this tall--

109
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,070
Whoa!

110
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,570
-He's fast!
-Thorfinn went first!

111
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,240
He's right at his chest!

112
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,700
You should at least humor your elders

113
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,580
when they're talking!

114
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,000
-He stood up!
-He's perfectly fine!

115
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,470
He blew him away with one strike.

116
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,010
Don't be ridiculous. Thorfinn jumped.

117
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,890
At close range, he knows his daggers
are advantageous.

118
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,480
He's grown strong.

119
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,100
That's it, kid!

120
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,100
Askeladd!

121
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,480
Kill him!

122
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,410
He's got it!

123
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,630
Damn it.

124
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,390
That's it!

125
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,470
Get him!

126
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,970
Just a little more, kid!

127
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,850
You know, Thorfinn.

128
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,270
Your father…

129
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,440
Wait, what was his name again?

130
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,530
Let's see. Tho…

131
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,660
Tho… Tho…

132
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,830
Thors!

133
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,950
Thors! That's right.

134
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,210
It's no use.
I've grown forgetful in my old age.

135
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,920
But, you know,

136
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm sorry to bring it up in the middle
of your fight for revenge,

137
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,260
but I've killed dozens of men.

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't remember your father.

139
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,400
Did I really kill him?

140
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,480
This "Thoril."

141
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,190
Now,

142
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,400
how exactly did I kill him?

143
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,700
Could you perhaps
have misunderstood something?

144
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,410
Bastard.

145
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,120
If you had fought fairly,

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,920
my father would have never lost.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,130
Back then, you used me.

148
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,470
You used me as a hostage!

149
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,390
Oh, now I remember!

150
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,610
He was the idiot who threw away his sword
in exchange for his kid!

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,290
What did he just do?

152
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,550
You can't get so worked up.

153
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,760
You still lack training, kid.

154
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,060
Damn you!

155
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,570
Bjorn, help him up.

156
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,490
Got it.

157
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,160
Boy, I'm hungry.

158
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,910
Alright.

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,960
Old man!

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,170
I'm hungry for some mutton.

161
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,670
Roasted with herbs.

162
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,740
I've been waiting for this!

163
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,950
It's freezing outside.
Who's watching the ships?

164
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,620
I got lucky.
Thorfinn didn't want to switch.

165
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:23,380
You mean he's still being a sore loser?

166
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,340
He's been like that from the beginning.

167
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,760
He goes there to cool off.

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,350
That ship was his father's to begin with.

169
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,770
Just let him be.

170
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,860
Not bad.

171
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Askeladd!

172
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,160
Today's duel was impressive!

173
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,570
Is that so?

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,790
At the end, you threw him, didn't you?

175
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,410
How did you do it?

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,250
That was incredible!

177
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,300
But Captain, are you sure you want
to let a kid like that on your ship?

178
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,460
What if he attacks you in your sleep?

179
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,590
It's fine.

180
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,090
That boy won't do a thing.

181
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,140
What do you mean?

182
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,100
It's because he's still a warrior.

183
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,940
He wants to win a fight fair and square.

184
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,570
His past and his pride hold him back.

185
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,960
You again, Horda?

186
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,710
You're disrupting everyone!

187
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,210
Clean this up now!

188
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,460
How long are you going to act
like nobility?

189
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,260
Stand! Get up!

190
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
You clumsy fool!

191
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,970
I don't really understand.

192
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,010
If I had to live without pride,
I'd probably kill myself.

193
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:01,810
What?

194
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,020
Is that funny?

195
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,980
No, it's not you.

196
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,030
Look.

197
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,530
What a sorry sight.

198
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,990
I've had it with you!
Act like the slave you are!

199
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,370
A man enslaved by money

200
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,830
whipping a slave he bought,
so he could act like a master.

201
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,630
He just lacks self-awareness.

202
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,050
All men are slaves to something.

203
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,480
Sulking are we?

204
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,490
Father!

205
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,930
There, there, crybaby caterpillar.

206
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,650
Does it hurt, little one?

207
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,070
You want revenge?

208
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,160
You're my son.

209
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,450
It's pointless for me
to try to dissuade you.

210
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,410
That's a problem.

211
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,170
What should I say?

212
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,800
You may have to realize it on your own.

213
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,050
I told you, didn't I?

214
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,640
You do not have enemies.

215
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,220
No one has enemies.

216
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,270
A true warrior does not need a sword…

217
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Well…

218
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,920
Lord Gorm told me
to bring you some dinner.

219
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,110
Hey.

220
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,580
Are you a slave too?

221
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,490
What?

222
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,580
It's just that you're eating out here.

223
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,330
I am a warrior.

224
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,960
Unlike you, I can choose
where to have my meals.

225
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,960
Really?

226
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,090
I feel like you and I
are one and the same.

227
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,350
What do I care for a slave's feelings!

228
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,890
If I were you, I'd kill Gorm and escape.

229
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,480
And I'd kill all my pursuers!

230
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,650
How awful.

231
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,150
Kill?

232
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,240
Then remain a slave for life.

233
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
That's your choice.

234
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,790
If I ran…

235
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,750
If I ran on and on to the end of the sea,

236
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,630
what would I find there?

237
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,090
There's probably nothing there.

238
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,720
No matter where I go,
it's the same as here.

239
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,140
Only war and slave traders.

240
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,120
Far to the west…

241
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,290
and beyond the sea…

242
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,870
is a land called Vinland.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,880
It is a warm and plentiful place,

244
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,720
so far that slave traders
and the flames of war cannot reach it.

245
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,220
There, no one would pursue you.

246
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,310
Does such a place truly exist?

247
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,230
AUGUST 1013 A.D.
NEAR JELLING, DENMARK

248
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,900
We are gathering Denmark's finest
from every corner of the land.

249
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:51,410
Additionally, four Jomsviking battalions
are hastening to join us.

250
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,920
This time, our offensive
will go ahead without fail.

251
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,760
Finally.

252
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,380
Those insolent men of England

253
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,180
will see the power of a king.

254
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,640
Yes. All battalions are ready

255
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,270
to fulfill Your Majesty's will
to seize England.

256
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,780
And Canute? Has he come?

257
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,690
Yes.

258
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,360
His Highness has entered Jelling.

259
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,280
He is resting in preparation
for the imminent march to battle.

260
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,740
Your Majesty.

261
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,160
Will you not reconsider?

262
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,370
Ragnar.

263
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Must His Highness Canute
accompany the army?

264
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,300
He is a prospective heir to the throne.

265
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,510
He must be given a chance to show valor
to not fall behind his brother Harald.

266
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,310
But His Highness is fearful
and lacks experience on the battlefield.

267
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,770
Ragnar.

268
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,140
I, too, am concerned for Canute's welfare.

269
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,070
But as leaders of the Vikings,

270
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,570
we must show valor
in order to lead the people.

271
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,860
We set sail in the morning.

272
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,970
In August of 1013 A.D.,

273
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,520
the main Viking fleet of Denmark
commanded by King Sweyn

274
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,360
began its invasion into the River Humber
of northern England.

275
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,990
After forcing the surrender of the five
major towns around Gainsborough,

276
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,950
without losing momentum,

277
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,580
the main army
took a land route down south.

278
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,460
They advanced forward
while trampling down every region.

279
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,460
However, the steady advance
that they believed would continue

280
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,880
stalled upon reaching a certain point…

281
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,390
the bustling city of commerce, London.

282
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,230
OCTOBER 1013 A.D.
LONDON, ENGLAND

283
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,540
What's wrong?

284
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,920
Come attack me!

285
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,920
Isn't this a fun war?

286
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:24,930
