Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.24,0:08:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,I can make the plans, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.94,0:08:38.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Eren, if there's something you don't understand, you must learn to comprehend it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.72,0:08:43.14,Default,,0,0,0,,It's more than worth risking our lives for.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.44,0:08:48.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Can we get started soon, Eren?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.98,0:08:53.34,Default,,0,0,0,,I'll fire a signal flare for you when we're ready.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:53.55,0:08:56.01,Default,,0,0,0,,After that, whatever you do is your call.
